This is a super fun event that the university puts on every year, giving the students, faculty, staff, and local community a chance to come together and have some really great times. It’s one of the highlights of the year in Davis, and a really fun tradition.Sadly, it was cancelled in both 2020 and 2021 because of the pandemic. These were the first times Picnic Day was cancelled outside of a single year during WWII, and while totally reasonable - I wouldn’t have gone if they’d had it, anyway - it was really too bad to miss them.One of the biggest parts of the day is a huge parade, and every year since 2010, I’ve organized the NCDMC group to drive in it. We get a different number of cars every year - our maximum to date has been 9. Side note, it’s a goal of mine to get 10, but we haven’t quite managed it yet.Anyway, we are one of the highlights of the parade - crowds absolutely go insane when we cruise by, and it’s just a ton of fun. We dress up in our dorkiest branded t-shirts, blare the Back to the Future soundtrack, do a little bit of synchronized driving with the doors up, etc. It’s low effort on our part and high impact for the crowd!This time around, I managed to get Clint, Stephen, Rich, Dave S, and myself arranged. Not the biggest turnout but the most loyal members for sure!Here we are all lined up in our staging areaMe, posing like a dork. Did I mention the dorky branded merch? This is a vintage factory racing jacket.Kind of a cool shot from the passenger side wing mirrorA goofy selfie of me, with my BTTF II hat on, and the cars all lined up behind me to merge into the paradeUnfortuantely, we did have one minor breakdown in the middle of the parade. I always tell our drivers that this parade is only 10 blocks long, but it’s the hardest day your car will have all year. All the idling, warm weather, tight turning, warm weather, clutching, driving with the doors raised - it’s tough on even the best maintained car. The most common issue we see is overheating, and this year was no exception.We’re still troubleshooting exactly why, but one of our drivers (not me) seems to have had an electrical glitch in their fans, which allowed the cooling system to develop an air bubble and barf a lot of the coolant out of the overflow bottle. This starts a vicious cycle where the bubble gets bigger, the engine starts to run dry, and of course, overheating is next. Luckily he caught it very quickly, pulled over into a safe alley, and we came back at the end of the parade to help him refill and get back on his way.And of course, no parade is complete without a beer afterwards. We stopped at the farm to try some of the new releases." }, { "title": "Major Suspension Overhaul", "url": "/2017/06/major-suspension-overhaul/", "categories": "General Thoughts", "tags": "restoration, repair, suspension, photo", "date": "2017-06-20 19:14:43 -0700", "snippet": "After several years of deferring what I knew was a very necessary job, Clint and I replaced the suspension in my car this weekend. I did the springs and steering a while ago, as the steering shaft had basically seized solid (and this had in turn caused the pinion gear in the rack to be worn smooth) and someone had tried to lower the car years ago by blowtorching the springs. They were all twisted and warped and just doing nothing to hold the car to the road. These changes made a huge difference at the time, but I realized I wasn’t quite done.Time to change all that.First, the parts.A big box full of various bushings arrived first – the long cylindrical ones will be pressed into the rear links and front control arms, while the round ones will support the sway bar.A huge pile of link bushings.The most exciting thing in this box, however, were the brand new custom made lower ball joints. They’re perfectly machined and just a beautiful thing. For many years, DeLorean owners were having to take old VW ball joints and modify them to fit the car – a dangerous proposition as the strength of the part was greatly reduced by the modifications. These are purpose-built and just awesome – there’s no excuse for going with anything else.A box arrived from Summit Racing, filled with black semi-gloss powdercoat mediaBut then the really exciting stuff arrived. In a box all the way from The Netherlands, from where DMC Europe ships some of the finest performance-enhancing parts in the world.First up are these amazing control arm braces. Made from solid stainless, these attach the pivot point for the front lower control arms directly to the base of the shock, effectively turning the lower arm into a full wishbone. More on this later.And lastly, the piece de resistance – custom made, adjustable height, 14-position adjustable damping AVO shocks, complete with polyurethane bushings all around.Enough unpacking. On to the good stuff.Now, usually I like to do my wrenching in the comfort of my own garage. But there are some jobs that you just need the proper tools to accomplish – and this was one of them. Clint was good enough to offer up use of his bay, tools and considerable skills for the day – so I headed up to Sacramento and we got to work.The first thing that had to happen – removing all the old bits. Here you can see basically the entire rear suspension (except the radius arms) laying on the ground under the car.It actually looks kinda good in Hover Mode, doesn’t it? For some reason the lines of the car make it look like it really shouldn’t have wheels. Or maybe that’s just the movies influencing me. Either way, this was a funny sight.We decided to blast, clean and powder-coat as many of the factory parts as we could. Here you can see one of the rear links. It’s actually quite clean and the paint in very good shape, considering.But, a little time in this cabinet would remove all that. Actually, it took a lot of time for those links. The paint was so well adhered that it took forever to blast off. And it seemed even longer than it was, since the blasting cabinet is outside in the 110 degree sun.A fully blasted and cleaned link, no paint remaining.Next it’s time for this bad boy.By applying a ~15,000 volt current to the metal part, the powder coating system creates a magnetic charge that attracts the fine particles of the media. You then bake it in a hot oven for about 30 minutes (with a temperature change halfway through), and the results are…Pretty amazing. A hard, durable, uniform coating that will stand the test of time. These came out really, really beautiful.With the links all cleaned up, we pressed the bushings into them (4 on each side) and reassembled the rear suspension.Here you can see one of the new rear shocks compared to the 36+ year old factory Girling. To be honest, I think it’s quite rare to get quite as much life out of a set of shocks as these gave, but as you can see the new ones are quite an upgrade in appearance, quality and technology. The red collar on the new shock allows for the adjustment of the ride height, which we set to be the same as it had been previously. The small red knob at the base is a 14-position variable valving mechanism that allows for totally adjustable damping rates. To start, we set it right in the middle at position #7. And then kept it there.The rear suspension is pretty simple to work on, and so went back together very quickly. Here you can see the new shock installed and the newly coated links connecting the wheel carrier to the frame behind it. Remember that the springs are also upgraded, but had been done previously.Now on to the front!This is one of the front lower control arms. The paint here didn’t hold up anywhere near as well over the years – lots of flaking, corrosion, and general road muck had really hurt the beauty here. These are also a structurally weak design – completely open at the bottom, they can be prone to cracking while the vehicle is in motion and causing significant damage or injury. Fortunately nearly 40 years of field testing has proven there’s a pretty simple way to fix that with a welded shoe plate. First, though – it has to be cleaned.After just a few minutes in the blasting cabinet, these look simply immaculate. The paint on those rear links was like the orchestra on the Titanic, but the paint up here was more like “it’s cool, I’m only here because my mom made me” and came off very, very quickly.Once the blasting was done, Clint reinforced the whole arm by fully welding all the areas that were simply tacked together and adding this entire base plate. This arm was completely open at the bottom before – the whole top section was just built in this picture.After another trip to the blasting cabinet to clean up the welding marks, the arms had their turn with the powder coating gun. And they came out amazing – better than new in every way.Once the coating was fully cooled, new bushings and ball joints got pressed in to the arms and it was time to start installing.New and old front shocks. The front ones don’t have the adjustable ride height, but do have the variable damping valve. You can see where the previous attempt at lowering the car with a blowtorch melted the collar around the old shock. This will be a huge improvement. Also, historically noteworthy – the red painted nut at the top of the old shock indicates that a very, very old recall was completed. The factory didn’t install a jam nut here and the shocks would come loose.Here’s one of those freshly coated control arms, with a brand new ball joint installed and attached to the frame. You can see the stainless bracing arms here – they box in the arm and all but eliminate fore/aft motion under braking, acceleration and steering.And here is the whole front driver’s side, reassembled and ready to tackle the road.Lastly, a trip back up the alignment rack to check ride height and torque all the fasteners under load – everything looks good, so it’s road test time!I can’t say enough good things about how it felt on that first drive. All of the front end vibration is gone. It used to nosedive so hard under heavy braking that it felt like it would dig into the ground, but now barely even leans. There’s no lash in the body when shifting gears or accelerating quickly, and the steering is at least twice as precise. Body roll is all but gone and it will no longer bottom out on driveways or shake your fillings loose on bumpy pavement.All in all, an amazing upgrade and a really fun day. Really big and special thanks to Clint for his time, tools, skills, shop space and awesome friendship. It really pays to know the right people!" }, { "title": "Getting caught up", "url": "/2017/06/getting-caught-up/", "categories": "General Thoughts", "tags": "restoration, repair, body, events, ncdmc, photo, electrical", "date": "2017-06-19 19:33:20 -0700", "snippet": "Wow, has it really been almost three years since my last post? I didn’t realize how much time had gone by. Between work and all the other stuff going on, I just haven’t thought to keep this site up to date with everything I’ve done.Yesterday was a huge event for 8BIT, so before I launch into that more detailed post I thought I would just document the last couple of years worth of work in one summary post.After the alignment work in January, there was an oil change, a new battery, and a replacement audio head unit. For some reason the JVC I had installed just up and died one day – no warning, it just stopped outputting audio. Got a really nice Pioneer DEH-X8700BH instead and am very happy with the additional control it gives me over subwoofer/crossover frequencies and volume.I also replaced the ashtray with one from a Porsche 924 – the original one’s door had stopped staying closed and it was bugging me. New gas pistons all around have the doors, boot and bonnet lifting smoother and stronger than ever. Got this set from PJ Grady and couldn’t be happier with them – I’ve bought so many sets of crappy ones over the years and these are the best and longest lasting to date.We had a great time in a few more years of the UBSCC All British Car Show, taking some 2nd and 3rd place trophies. I don’t know why I don’t seem able to lock down that first place – but it’s not about the awards, it’s about the people and the fun!Then, on a hot and sunny day last June – disaster! I had taken the car out for an early morning drive and was having a great time. I was sitting at a stoplight and was about to go through when… nothing. The engine just sputtered and died, and wouldn’t restart. No amount of cranking would bring it to life. Eventually I gave up and called a tow truck home, where a few hours of diagnosis revealed that my fuel pump had cooked itself. Apparently, you have to keep the fuel tank pretty full on these hot California days, as the gasoline acts as a coolant for the submerged pump. I was fairly low on fuel and the heat just got to it. I agree, that sounds ridiculous; but apparently it’s true. A replacement pump was dispatched to me and I got the car running in no time flat, though at a pretty considerable expense.It was also during this little incident that I also decided my taillights and flashers weren’t bright enough, since people kept pulling up behind my clearly disabled vehicle and honking at me to move. More on that in a bit.After that, a stroke of surprising good luck! Chris Nicholson, the leading world expert on stainless repair and regraining was making a trip to Northern California. Not just to San Francisco or San Jose, but right to my little town – at a shop less than 5 miles from my house. Amazing fortune – because I have been wanting to have a few small dents removed and a full-body regrain for years now. It was just a prohibitive expense to ship the car to someone qualified, so I put it on the back burner. But with Chris coming to town – there was no excuse.The difference was amazing. I had him pull and rework every dent on the car, straighten out the T-panel and grain every inch of stainless. It’s never looked better; I don’t think I quite realized how much better it could look until it was done.Rob Grady also aligned the doors so they open and shut smoothy and solidly, better than ever. It was a great feeling to get in the car and have the door close with a finger touch.After that, it was a pretty uneventful few months. The car mostly sat undriven as I was traveling a lot and we had a very rainy winter which saw me taking my daily driver more frequently.Fast forward to April, when we had our annual participation in the yearly UC Davis Picnic Day Parade. As always, it was a super fun day filled with great discussion, nerdy talk, beer and of course, DeLoreans. It also yielded what is quite honestly the best picture ever taken of my car – one of the UCD press photographers took it and used it in the official record of the day. Check this out:Simply a stunning photo. Perfect focus, depth of field, color, lighting, and the car is really showing well.But, of course, I wasn’t the only one there…All told we had 7 cars this year. Still haven’t cracked the 10-car barrier, but maybe next year! After the parade, we had a nice back-country drive up to the Berryessa Brewing Company for some beers, dinner and conversation. And since we can’t travel anywhere in a group without causing a bit of a stir, we spent some time answering questions and showing off the cars to our gathering fans.After the parade, I started having some troubles with my interior lighting in the car. The dome lights were coming on at weird times, or not at all – the instrument panel illumination was blinking oddly, and the whole system just seemed to have gremlins in it. After a few solid days of troubleshooting and back-breaking periods hunched over the relay compartment, I tracked it down to some bad ground crimps in the forward relay strip.These pins are all crimped together in a daisy-chain series arrangement, and the double crimps seem to go bad over time. Dave McKeen (known as Bitsyncmaster and famous for his solid-state electrical replacements, which I run many of) makes a custom relay ground bus for exactly this situation, which I happily installed.This much higher gauge and solidly connected bus (combined with a replacement dome light module, which had been fried by the bad connection) fixed the dome light issues.Remember back when my fuel pump failed, and I decided my taillights were too dim? Well, I finally decided to do something about that. A long time ago I converted the car to 100% LED, both to reduce electrical draw and heat output and increase visibility. But LED technology has really progressed since then, and it was time for a refresh.Enter a huge pile of so-called “Plasma” LEDs. These ultra-premium bulbs promise the highest possible light output and uniformity of any automotive LED on the market.Here you can see a new Plasma bulb (lower left) next to the more traditional SMD based LED towers, and some of the original incandescent bulbs for good measure.I have to say, once installed – I can’t argue their claims. They are at least twice as bright, and quite difficult to capture with a camera as they overwhelm the sensor and cause the whole scene to be dimmed down. Here’s the best I could do. The Plasma bulbs are installed in the left hand cluster only.Of course, no DeLorean project is complete without a little drama. Back when I did the first LED conversion, I upgrade the flasher module to an LED compatible one – these things rely on resistance, and with the reduced load of LEDs, a traditional module won’t be able to blink them.Well, guess what. It didn’t work with the new bulbs! Why can’t anything ever be simple… and, of course, since it had been working previously I tore half the car apart trying to track down this gremlin before checking into something that was supposed to be properly set up.Changing it out for this module fixed the issue, and only took 30 seconds. Putting the whole rest of the car back together took the better part of a day.With the LED situation figured out, I moved on to something I’d been meaning to do for quite some time. Now that the stainless was looking so good, I thought it might be time to install my bumper letter inserts.Again, drama struck – I tried about 10 different kinds of mounting tape and transfer adhesives before I finally found one that was thin enough to keep the letters from sticking out, but thick enough to compensate for the slight curve in the plastic bumper.Finally, though… Success. And it looks so good. I wish I had done it a long time ago – these letters have been sitting in my parts box for at least 4 years.Finally, I was motivated to deal with something that had been bothering me for a long time – the alignment and overall condition of my center console switches. I bought a brand new rear defroster switch from DMC Europe as well as the upgrade LED-illuminated window switches from DMC Houston and installed them in the so-called “Mattaligner” from PJ Grady. This alignment frame provides a stiff surface for the switches to mount to, as opposed to the flimsy cardboard of the center console – and lets them sit straight and without constantly popping out. Combined with the much improved feel of the new switches, this goes a long way towards making the interior feel solid and modern.And that’s it! All caught up for the last couple of years. I will try to write more often from now on rather than having these long posts. They get a little flavorless when the info is so old." }, { "title": "Time for an alignment", "url": "/2015/01/time-for-an-alignment/", "categories": "General Thoughts", "tags": "restoration, repair, suspension, alignment, photo", "date": "2015-01-22 17:14:33 -0800", "snippet": "Long ago, nearly two years before I started this blog, #2100 got a new steering rack. This was due to the incredible steering difficulty that came from a completely seized intermediate shaft as well as the fact that it wasn’t tracking straight. No big deal, it was a relatively simple job for an afternoon.But since then, it hasn’t had the wheels aligned. We did the best we could with tape measures and bits of string, but that’s far from accurate.Since Clint has access to a fancy Hunter rig at his shop – one of the ones with frickin’ lasers on it – and I actually trust him to do a job like this and not screw it up or crash my car, David and I took a trip to visit him and see what the story was.So, here are David and Clint getting ready to check 8Bit’s measurements.She looks really good on the rig. The alignment machine is a really amazing piece of technology – I know it’s pretty common but I haven’t used one before, and I guess I’m easily impressed.For those who aren’t familiar with how this works (I wasn’t until last weekend), you basically attach these specially calibrated giant reflector panels to the wheels…And then the tower at the front of the machine shoots frickin’ lasers at them, to measure the telemetry from the reflected light.And then… voila! Instant and incredibly accurate measurements. Too bad they really aren’t that positive.Unfortunately, many of these adjustments are not fixable on the DeLorean. A lot of the suspension points are permanently set by the frame and fixed rear links. We did correct the front toe, since that is adjustable via the tie rod ends. Fortunately the others are not really dramatic and shouldn’t hurt anything. I do want to try and get the front end straightened out a bit (there is a little play to be achieved using washers in certain places) to try and quell some of the wheel vibration. Tire balancing may also be an issue, which we’ll check next time.We also did a quick oil change on her while she was on the lift – amazing how much easier it is when you aren’t laying on your back.And then we brought in David’s car for a check as well. He seems to be surprised at how out of whack it was….Until next time!" }, { "title": "Another new water pump", "url": "/2015/01/another-new-water-pump/", "categories": "General Thoughts", "tags": "restoration, repair, cooling, engine, photo", "date": "2015-01-11 10:44:08 -0800", "snippet": "So this was a surprise but not entirely unexpected job. Last weekend, after coming home from our holiday trip I noticed a small drip of coolant under the car. This isn’t at all unusual when it starts to get cold outside – there are dozens of hose to pipe connections under the car, and they will develop small drips from time to time with drastic temperature changes. So I pulled out my pressure tester, prepared to seek out and snug up any of these small drips as I do every year.Now, this would be a good time to point out that for a long time now there has been a tiny spot of green film near the pulley of my water pump, an indication that the seal around the pulley shaft was starting to fail. I was sort of in denial about this situation since I already replaced this pump just a few short years ago. But, I was new to DeLorean ownership at the time and purchased a re-manufactured pump from a less than reputable source to save a few bucks.Fast forward to the application of my pressure tester. Normally this is uneventful – hook it to the expansion tank, give it a few pumps, look for wetness and tighten the clamps where needed. Not this time. This time, the pump shaft seal failed in a rather spectacular fashion, geysering coolant all out of the front of the motor. Sigh. I depressurized the system, mopped up the floor and called DMC Midwest to get a new pump.And here it is! This is a beautiful NEW pump, with no re-manufactured, re-used or NOS parts to be found. Thanks to David and Clint’s help, we had the new pump installed and everything working again in one quick afternoon. A testament to both how good I’ve gotten at tearing into the valley and to how bulletproof the motor in #2100 is – it fired back up with zero leaks and a perfect idle on the very first try. The hardest part of the WP install is getting the four hoses lined up perfectly at once – two on the back and one on either side. They are all very short connections made in tight spaces, and the short hose lengths mean very limited flexibility. A very light application of silicone lubricant at the connection points makes a huge difference in getting things to slide together properly.Anyway, that’s all for now – everything is back to running perfectly. Next weekend we may do an alignment and a dyno test – fun! I also need to flush and replace the clutch and brake fluid and do an oil change soon. For now I think I’ll stick to a car wash. It hasn’t had one in months due to the drought. I think I can get away with a quick one." }, { "title": "NCDMC Sonoma Coast Drive, Nov 2014", "url": "/2014/11/ncdmc-sonoma-coast-drive-nov-2014/", "categories": "General Thoughts", "tags": "events, ncdmc, drives, photo", "date": "2014-11-03 22:01:23 -0800", "snippet": "Another awesome excursion with the club guys. This time around it was myself and Kate, Rich and Kathy, David and Heather and Brian and Kaylee. Let’s start out with the route for what turned out to be the best drive we’ve taken yet.In our particular case, Kate and I started in Vacaville. We met David and Heather in Fairfield and continued on to Petaluma to meet the rest of the crew.We met up at a Peet’s Coffee, where we ran into a kindred spirit with another John DeLorean designed car. After sharing some stories, he gave us a few tips on scenic roads for our drive and we started on our way.Here’s where we had our one malfunction of the day – Brian popped the fuse for his fuel pump. A very quick replacement later and we were all back in business.Our first stop from there was Guerneville, for a quick walk around the small town and some scenery.Then, it was back on the road to our next stop in Monte Rio for lunch. Here’s a snap of Rich leading the way!And here’s where we ended up eating – Don’s Dog Cafe. The food was actually pretty good and the ambiance and company were perfect. Thanks to David for this pic, I forgot to take any of the restaurant itself – I was too busy being impressed by Heather’s choice of meal. Yes, she ate every bite.The next stop was the visitor’s center in Jenner, where we parked at the boat launch for a quick photo opp…After that, it was back to our old haunt – Goat Rock Beach. This place never gets old, though as Rich said “it could be more scenic…”Most of us were looking pretty photogenic on this trip. Rich and Kathy were a little camera shy, I guess!On the way to our next stop, we drove through the town of Bodega Bay. Kate thought the huge stacks of crab traps were really cool…The following beach stop was at Bodega Head, where we all (most) had a chance to be photogenic again!Now, we come to the best part of the drive. We had decided to cap off the trip with a stop at the Lagunitas Brewing Company in Petaluma. This was a spur of the moment type thing and we had no prior arrangements or specific expectations, other than to go get a beer – and we had heard they had a fun tour. We had no idea what was in store for us…On our arrival, the first thing we noticed was the utter lack of parking. The lot was fairly small to begin with, but it was also completely packed to overflowing. Fortunately, 4 DeLoreans tend to make a bit of a scene wherever they go, and once the tour guide spotted us, this happened….Celebrity treatment, we thought. Safe parking – what more could we ask for? We walked inside, found a table in the beer garden and ordered a few flights.I told David to make a new face for this picture. That’s what he came up with.Speaking of flights, the Fusion 24 and the Born Yesterday were awesome. Anyway, about 10 minutes into our relaxation we were paid a visit by a local raconteur going by the name of Johnny Lightning. He told us it was his job to look after VIP guests (?!) such as ourselves, and that once we finished up with our drinks, he’d be happy to take us to the employee lounge, pull us a few pints and give us the inside story on the brewery before putting us on an official tour. He delivered.More Fusion 24, by the way. That stuff is great. Anyway, after a good long bull session and history lesson we joined the tour. Here’s Kate enjoying her Hop Stoopid 🙂Now on to the rest of the tour…The most important pipeline in that whole building…Anyway, once we wrapped up the tour, our host Johnny asked us if we’d mind pulling the cars into the production area, for a few photos. All the stainless tanks with the stainless cars were something that he and the brewer were really interested in capturing. Of course, we are always only too happy to oblige such requests, especially when we are being treated like rock stars!And, for our trouble (what little trouble it was to drink free beer and have people take our pictures) – a case of Lagunitas Sucks. Which is also delicious, by the way.After that, it was back to the highway and home! We put on about 220 miles total, and the cars performed wonderfully. With the exception of Brian’s fuel pump fuse and a loose interior light fuse in Rich’s car, no one had a single issue. 8BIT even managed to get 27 MPG over the course of the trip, even with all the low gear twisty driving. Long drives like this are my reward for all the countless hours and small fortune I’ve poured into making my car so reliable.Thanks to Rich for helping plan this whole thing and being our navigator, Brian, Kaylee, David, Heather, Kathy and Kate for just being generally cool to hang out with – and Lagunitas for making this a really memorable event!" }, { "title": "Halloween, 2014", "url": "/2014/10/halloween-2014/", "categories": "General Thoughts", "tags": "photo", "date": "2014-10-31 18:18:11 -0700", "snippet": "Not actually a lot to say here, other than I finally completed my Marty McFly costume after almost 5 years.

It’s just that the car has been running perfectly since the fuel pump was repaired, and due to my crazy work/travel schedule I haven’t done much driving this summer.Anyway, today I decided to remove the fuel tank closing plate and inspect it. It’s one of the few pieces of the car that hasn’t been removed and cleaned/upgraded/repaired since I’ve had it. It was clear to see that at some point in the car’s life, the brake master cylinder had failed and leaked fluid all over the frame underneath. This had eaten away the epoxy and allowed surface rust to form, which was pretty ugly and could lead to structural problems down the line if not dealt with.So, here’s what I found when I first removed the plate:As you can see, the epoxy in this corner is all bubbled up and detached from the metal. Water has gotten in underneath and started rusting the plate. The only way to deal with this is to strip off the damaged epoxy, grind away as much rust as possible and treat the plate with rust-inhibiting paint to match the frame.Step 1: I just peeled away the loose epoxy. It pulled off in huge chunks.Step 2: Scraping away the more stubborn chunks of damaged epoxy and brushing the surface rust with a wire brushStep 3: The remaining epoxy in the affected areas was a little better adhered, but still needed to be removed. A razor blade was used for this, followed by more wire brushingFinally, I went at the good epoxy with some degreaser to start cleaning the grime off.Looks a lot better. The next step will be to finish really prepping the surface with a wire wheel, followed by a primer, some POR-15, and a coat of Rustoleum to protect the POR-15 and match the rest of the plate.

This was a significant (and expensive) upgrade to the car, as it eliminates the complicated pickup baffle system and failure/inaccuracy prone level sender to power the fuel gauge. But, as it turned out, this pump was not without design problems of its own. Many users (including local owner Ryan) reported that the pump was unable to hold rest pressure and was introducing hot start issues where none previously existed. While I was not seeing this behavior myself, I did notice that the car seemed to suffer from sputtering and loss of power under load when the tank was low – 1/4 full or less. The symptoms were the same as those of a collapsed pickup hose in the OEM configuration – one of the exact problems I was trying to eliminate by upgrading the pump.Another owner on DMCTalk suggested that since the lower portion of the pump is spring-loaded to ensure it rests on the bottom of the tank, perhaps it had compressed and gotten stuck during installation. This would lead to the last dregs of fuel being unable to be sucked up and would easily account for the problems I was seeing. Due to my busy schedule, it took me a few months to run the fuel tank low enough to do a proper inspection – but I was finally able to a few weeks ago. I was not surprised but a little discouraged to find that the installation was correct – something else must be going on.First I checked to see if the float for the sender was just caught somehow – maybe I’m actually out of fuel and just don’t know it? To do that, I held the float down with a rod and checked the gauge.Nope, no problem there….Deciding to take a chance, I had Colleen start the car while I observed the pump operation through the blanked-off OEM sender hole. Here’s what I saw.Uh oh. That’s almost certainly not supposed to happen…. Taking a closer look, it became clear that the fuel was spraying out of the top of the pump itself. Why is that happening?To really analyze the part, I had no choice but to remove it from the car. After inspection, it didn’t seem that the unit was physically damaged or defective in any way, and the whole thing was as clean as could be:So what the hell? I called Dave at DMC Midwest and described my symptoms. Once he watched the videos above, he agreed that something was clearly not right and that he needed to get his hands on the pump for testing. So off it went to Crystal Lake. After a few days, he called me back – he couldn’t replicate what I was seeing, and there was nothing obviously wrong with the unit. But the videos and evidence I had were undeniable, and he generously replaced the whole pump for me.A week later…A brand new assembly arrived, complete with an inline check valve meant to eliminate the hot start problems that other owners like Ryan had observed. Great! I set about installing the new assembly and check valve – I messed the latter up, installing it in the return line rather than the feed line. Luckily I caught my mistake immediately and was able to swap the lines around to fix it.Here’s the check valve installed and ready to go.So, now I was really excited to get my car back on the road and go enjoy the nice weather. Video camera in hand, we fired up the engine and….F@$$#(@$#(@*%*@(!!!!!! What is causing this???After trading a dozen more emails and phone calls with DMCMW, Dave agreed that the problem must be environmental to my car and that we needed to do some live troubleshooting. He agreed to spend his Saturday on a videoconference with me while some tests were carried out – nice guy, huh? Clint and David joined me for the event and we got to work.The first thing we tried was inspecting the lines at the fuel distributor – any kinks or twists?Nope, looks good. Next test was to disconnect the feed line and run the pump into a bucket.Unhooked this line, and did this with it:Plenty of fuel there, so there’s no blockage. So we’re no closer yet.We did notice that with the engine off (fuel pump just jumpered in the wiring harness to run all the time) there was much less pressure behind the leak.That was confusing, since the pump should be providing the same pressure regardless. So that led us to conclude that the issue was worsening under load. That made a little sense, since the symptoms of power loss and hesitation really only occurred under acceleration or high speed highway cruising. As you can see in the videos below, the motor fires right up and runs just fine at idle, even with the leaking pump.Hooking up a set of K-Jet pressure gauges we borrowed from Ryan, we tested the control pressure and vacuum to the regulator. Everything was dead on. The accumulator also held rest pressure for an extraordinarily long time (a very good thing) – so there’s no major systemic failures.Dave was stumped, and so were we. The lines were all new. The filter was new. Pump was new. Injectors were recently cleaned. He agreed to think it over some more and we ended our video chat.About an hour later he called back with an idea – every fuel line was brand new, but did I do the ones no one ever thinks of? There are two short lengths of flexible line that connect the accumulator at the center of the frame to the sections of hard line running from end to end of the car. No – I had purchased replacement parts, but due to the difficulty of installing them, I hadn’t gotten to it yet. Dave suggested we inspect those lines for kinks or breaks. Here’s what we found:That almost certainly isn’t good. These old style fuel hoses are a three-layer design: a thin rubber outer sheath around a protective woven layer, covering a nylon (or Teflon) core line. The core section is stiff – and in this chunk of line, it had bent into a pretty severe kink and stuck that way. This was a serious “well, there’s your problem” moment for us.Cutting the line out, we could see the full extent of the kink:It makes total sense that this was allowing enough fuel to flow at idle, but starving the motor completely when the demand increased. So with Clint’s help (and power of super skinniness) the old line was cut out and a brand new one installed in only about 20 minutes. It was sheer luck that I had exactly the parts we needed sitting on the shelf. He also tightened up a shift pivot bolt that was a little loose – that tiny cubby in the frame is one place I couldn’t reach to do this kind of stuff myself.Excited that we might have finally solved it, I climbed into the trunk to take one last video…And here’s what we saw!Success! What you see above is the exact expected behavior of the pump. It should run quietly and without leaks, the baffle should fill up almost immediately and keep overflowing constantly until the pump shuts off or every drop of fuel is exhausted. It seems that the kinked hose was causing a backpressure condition that was in turn causing a pressure relief valve at the top of the pump to open and spray fuel everywhere.After that, it was time for a road test – and what a difference it made. Not only did the sputtering and power loss disappear, but the car overall had more pep and the shifts were even more precise thanks to the re-torqued pivot bolt. Amazing.Thanks for reading this far and thanks to Clint, David, Ryan and especially DMCMW for helping with this!" }, { "title": "Sacramento Korean Festival", "url": "/2013/10/sacramento-korean-festival/", "categories": "General Thoughts", "tags": "ncdmc, events, photo", "date": "2013-10-20 09:51:21 -0700", "snippet": "Saturday, some of the local owners and I were invited to show our cars at the Sacramento Korean Festival.

Got that sealed up nice and tight, though I worry about what kind of a mess I might be in for the next time I have to change that gasket. I also think that the rear main seal may still (!) be leaking a tiny bit. That freaking thing…what a pain.I also discovered that my two year old water pump may be starting to leak. I’m not 100% sure if it is or how bad it is yet, but it’s undeniable that there is a glob of coolant baked onto the timing cover where the water pump meets the block. I pressure tested the system and it held 16PSI for an hour and everything is staying cool, so I am going to monitor this and see. I really don’t want to do another water pump.On Thursday 8bit hit a milestone, clocking 56,000 miles on the odometer.

This time, instead of the DMC cork gasket, we used a hard fiber one from DPI. It cost a truly fantastic amount, but if you ask me you couldn’t put a price on just finally having this job done correctly.The oil pan is a bit of a challenge on this car, since the row of bolts around the rear edge of it is totally blocked by the engine cradle. Not wanting to remove the whole engine yet again, we took the shortcut of just removing the engine mount studs and hoisting the motor up slightly with the crane. We only needed about 2″ of clearance, so it was pretty easy to do.After draining the oil, we dropped the pan. It was immediately obvious that the cork gasket had suffered catastrophic and immediate failure. I can’t understand how anyone could use this part successfully – it’s complete garbage.As you can see, it warped, compressed and split pretty dramatically. This occurred at no more than the 11 ft/lb of torque that the shop manual prescribed. In fact, the warping became obvious at around 7 ft/lb.So, at nearly 5 times the price, we installed this gasket from DPI instead.Here’s David, utterly thrilled about the fancy new gasket. Clint is choking something back, but I’m not sure what…Applying High-Tack gasket sealant to both sides before reinstalling the pan. When I bought this stuff, I didn’t realize it also came in a spray can. That would have been much, much easier….Anyway, after reinstalling the pan and re-sealing the 123 rocker cover with some Right Stuff on the fiber gasket we re-filled the oil and ran the motor for 20 minutes or so. Absolutely no oil appeared anywhere. We decided to call it a night and get some dinner.This morning I checked under the car again, and there were no new drips on the cardboard or evident at any of the previously leaking spots on the motor. Taking that at face value, I reinstalled all the remaining parts of the rear end and the radiator duct and went out for a drive. The fuel pump seems to be working great, the new radiator kept things nice and cool, and the car was driving perfectly. Outside of a high idle condition, which appears to be due to a minor maladjustment on the throttle control arm. I’ll tackle that tomorrow.So, I went for a nice long drive. Upon returning I cleaned up the whole garage, threw out all the old cardboard and put down fresh and pristine stuff under the motor. I’ll check back in a few hours and over the next few days to make sure no new drips appear, but I think we’ve finally got this thing sealed up – pun intended." }, { "title": "Improved Fuel Pump/Sender Combo", "url": "/2013/06/improved-fuel-pumpsender-combo/", "categories": "General Thoughts", "tags": "restoration, repair, fuel, photo", "date": "2013-06-07 19:34:38 -0700", "snippet": "One of the most head-scratching designs in the DeLorean is the fuel delivery system. The pump is submerged in the fuel tank, inside a rubber boot. There is a complicated pre-filter, pickup hose and baffle system to get fuel from the bottom of the tank into the pump and a separate level sending unit for the fuel gauge. There are a lot of disadvantages to this design, namely: Inaccurate fuel gauge readings that change wildly under acceleration, braking, lateral forces, and on hills When the tank is low, the bottomless baffle design can fail to deliver fuel when the vehicle is on an incline When the tank is hot (frequent around here), the pickup hose can collapse and fail to deliver fuel. A bonus of this is that the pump will heat up and can prematurely fail Rubber components (specifically the boot and boot cover) are incompatible with modern ethanol fuels. The rubber breaks down, falls to bits inside the tank, dissolves and turns to varnish, and can gum up the very sensitive K-Jetronic CIS. Teflon fuel hoses tend to degrade over time, possibly leading to leaksKind of a mouthful, and a lot of weak spots all in one rather important system. On the plus side, the revolutionary molded fuel tank is virtually indestructible and continues to be an excellent quality item.Anyway, DMC Houston stepped in with a kit designed to address all these shortcomings in a single shot. They adapted a modern day pump and float system to fit the DeLorean. There is speculation that it’s a GM sourced part, which I don’t really know for sure but it sounds reasonable. This kit replaces the teflon fuel hoses with ethanol compatible rubber and the large and heavy pump with a more modern design. The entire baffle and pickup system is replaced wholesale. The level sender is gone as well, in favor of an electronically controlled unit integrated into the pump.But, before the new pump can go in, the old equipment must be removed and the tank *thoroughly* cleaned. This is so important that DMC will not warranty the new pump/sender unit unless the tank has been completely sanitized prior to installation.Enter Tyvek man! Because of the nature of this job, I decided to pick up some protective gear. I’m not wearing it all in this shot, but I had a full body Tyvek suit, shoulder length PVC gloves, a respirator, goggles and a headlamp. Gasoline and acetone (for cleaning the tank) are both pretty nasty.So let’s get started. Here’s how you access the fuel pump, via this access panel under the spare tire.Access panel removed. You can see the degrading fuel hoses at the left (the white things that look like they should probably have rubber on them, but don’t) as well as the fuel pump (large black circle at center) and the level sender (smaller black circular unit). The cover over the fuel pump that the hoses come out of will frequently pop off during re-fueling, causing gas to spray everywhere. This happened twice on the PCH drive, and besides being stinky is unsafe and an environmental disaster.Here’s the old level sender removed. This still has a core value, so I will hold off on smashing it to pieces….First step is to cut the old fuel lines off. Because the barbed fittings on the hard lines are usually seized in place, this kit is designed to press new lines over the fittings rather than disconnecting them. If you crank too hard on those fittings you risk damaging the hard fuel lines, and replacing those is one of the VERY few jobs that would require you to remove the body from the frame of the car. Not good.Here is all the rubber that just broke off in shards from the outside of the old fuel lines.Here’s the old pump assembly in the boot. You can see the rubber boot is cracking and absolutely turning to dust. The hard line in front is the fuel return line that puts unused fuel back in the tank.Closeup on the destroyed rubber boot. You can see this car didn’t have a hard life based on the overall condition of the plated metal parts – but that didn’t stop this rubber from breaking down!And here’s the condition of the pump itself. Pretty gross and corroded, but it was still working very well. Bosch quality right there, I’m actually sorry to have one fewer Bosch part in my car now.Here you can see the complicated baffle assembly, still submerged in gas inside the tank. My super accurate level sender said this tank was half empty. Not so much… it was almost completely full.After draining the tank and removing the baffle assembly, here’s what remained. Filth, grime and piles of broken down rubber bits.Here are all the old pump/sender/tank components. You can see the dissolved rubber varnish forming on the bottom of the brown plastic disk in the upper right corner. That’s the pickup hose screen. I’m glad it was there to stop all that crap getting into my fuel system.And here’s the inside of the tank after a thorough scrubbing out with acetone and a vacuuming. Clean as a whistle, looks like brand new. That wire in the middle of the second shot is an anti-static device.Here’s the new pump and sender with the old stuff. The round unit is the baffle/pump/sender combo, and the small box with the wires is the logic box for the pump and electronic level sender unit.This is the new clamp to hold the pump unit down. First step is to lay this over the opening in the tank.This is a solid stainless plug to block up the hole where the old gauge sender used to be.Here are the barbed fittings on the hard lines where the soft hoses will attach from the pump.And here’s everything all installed! I didn’t have the electrical wires run yet in this photo. Everything fits and works perfectly.

At the time, we completely rebuilt my transmission, installed a new clutch and hydraulics, and replaced virtually every seal on the motor. Most of those jobs went great. Some of them, particularly the re-seal… not so much. The drips have been bothering me so we decided to tackle the job again.Armed with much more information about the leaky and temperamental nature of the PRV as well as a bunch of new parts and better materials, we tore in a second time.The carnage on the side of the garage as I prepare the day before. I removed the lower and upper engine covers, rear fascia, impact absorber, heat shields, muffler, alternator, intake manifold, fuel injection manifold, and some other odds and ends.Because I had bought a bench grinder for this job (to clean all the threads of bolts going into new seals) I decided to shine up the idle air pipe. Didn’t take a ‘before’ shot, but it was a dark, burned brass color. You don’t even see this part when it’s installed, but what the hell.With the top of the motor removed, we unhooked all the coolant hoses, removed the A/C compressor (leaning against the blankets in the upper left) and disconnected all the electrical harnesses. Hooking the crane up…Up and out! We are getting good at this… a little too good.One of the seal surfaces that wasn’t quite right was the metal to metal joint between the lower girdle and the block. So we transferred the motor to the stand, removed the pan and girdle and tried again. This time we cleaned all the sealing surfaces with a fancy 3M abrasive bristle brush on a die grinder. Sometimes having the right tool for a job makes all the difference – last time we went at the old seals with razor blades and chisels and it took hours. This bristle disk made very short work out of a much better cleanup job.Here’s the oil pan. This actually was not leaking last time, so it’s a shame we had to remove it and try again. My research turned up that we should use an OEM gasket instead of the Right Stuff sealant we had used the last time, so here it is. The sealant from last time was holding on so well that we had to run out and buy a blowtorch to burn it off. Foreshadowing? Perhaps…Front and back of the motor, all reassembled and testing for overall tightness. We also re-did the timing cover and valve cover gaskets, but didn’t take any photos of that this time. The trick with the timing cover is to use a lot of Right Stuff sealant as well as sealing the threads of all the bolts, as many of them don’t go into blind holes.As we were torquing down the oil pan bolts, however, Clint noticed that the gasket seemed to be deforming excessively. It was crushing and spreading and oozing out of the seam. It didn’t look good, but without a better alternative (and since we were told it would be fine), we moved on.Here’s me, re-wrapping some bits of the engine harness with new harness tape. Over the years some of the old wrap had frayed, ripped, and burned on the exhaust. Check out that nice clean engine cradle!Flywheel, still in great shape. It’s only got about 4000 miles on it so it better be.Clutch, same as the flywheel. I had a scary experience on the Pacific Coast drive with the clutch beginning to slip, but that appears to have been down to a mis-adjusted clevis rod into the master cylinder. No obvious damage to the clutch as a result, so that’s good.Motor reassembled and reinstalled, just about ready for a test.The oil pan… which would ultimately be the undoing of this whole task. After we went out for a short drive to make sure the clutch and shifter were all properly aligned, it became obvious that oil was absolutely pouring out around the bolts here. Apparently all my research had resulted in a miscommunication – I had purchased an “OEM Style” gasket made of cork. This is why it was deforming – we couldn’t even apply the correct torque to these bolts. What a mess. It turns out the recommended gasket was an “OEM Spec” one made of a hard fiber material. And costs more than 5 times as much.We also noticed that the camshaft closing plate gaskets in the back of the heads were leaking – right onto the exhaust manifolds. Stinky white smoke everywhere; not something I was used to. That was easy to fix, a quick bead of Right Stuff on the plate made short work of it. The oil pan, however… will have to be a job for another day. In the meantime, the car is parked…." }, { "title": "New Radiator and Cooling System Update", "url": "/2013/06/new-radiator-and-cooling-system-update/", "categories": "General Thoughts", "tags": "restoration, repair, cooling, hvac, photo", "date": "2013-06-07 18:30:21 -0700", "snippet": "Been a while since my last post, but there are a couple of really big ones coming!So about a week before the UC Davis parade, I noticed a little drip of coolant under the front of the car. I wasn’t too concerned as the weather was just starting to heat up, and it’s pretty common for me to have to snug up a few hose clamps as the warmer temperatures cause things to swell a little. Unfortunately, this time it appeared that the drip was coming not from a hose junction, but right from the radiator. It had been on my list for a while to replace this anyway, so I ordered a beautiful new replacement from Ed Uding in the Netherlands.Here’s the new radiator. It’s got about 10% more surface area than the one I removed. A common failure point on the OEM DeLorean radiator was the plastic side tanks that were crimped to the metal body. Over time those tanks would crack and leak from all the heat cycling. While my current radiator was not OEM and did in fact have metal tanks, this new design is superior. Instead of having crimped side tanks, these are well and truly welded in place. There is no way those will ever leak.And it wouldn’t be a DeLorean repair without a few “while you’re in there” jobs – so I’m also replacing the lower mounting brackets (mine were bent way upwards long ago, probably by a previous owner hitting a curb) as well as every rubber hose and hose clamp in the entire coolant path.Step 1 – jack up the front end. I call this the “OEM Suspension” pose 🙂Here’s where the drip was coming from – right behind this small hose junction. After I removed the radiator it became clear that the drip actually *was* coming from the hose and that the radiator was totally fine. But, that just means it made a nice gift for Clint.After removing the rubber hoses, this is the mess that greeted me on, around and inside all of the aluminum coolant pipes. I had to remove every one from the car and thoroughly clean and polish them to remove all the corrosion and sediment.Here are some pipes after a fresh polish at the tips. Tough to compose a photo under the car, sorry!And some brand new hoses. Should be good for another few decades, at least.Old and new lower radiator brackets. The bend isn’t immediately obvious here because I had used a pry bar to try and get the existing ones lined up many moons ago. But I was worried about any misalignment in these brackets potentially tweaking the new radiator and decided to just replace them rather than find myself sorry later. Besides, that fresh yellow zinc plating just looks so good!One of the bigger hassles of this job is getting the air conditioning condenser out of the way carefully. The radiator is sandwiched between the condenser and the fans, but since I don’t want to disconnect the refrigerant hoses, some careful maneuvering is required. Here you can see the old radiator standing on the left and the condenser on the right.With the old radiator finally removed, it’s time for a comparison shot! You can see how much nicer the new unit is. Note the crimped tanks on the old black unit.All done! Here’s the new radiator and new lower brackets, mounted between the fans and condenser. The fans are also new, but the condenser is original. It works perfectly but is ugly as sin. Not really much point in replacing that, sadly. I also need to get that sway bar powder coated, as it is the only rusty part on the whole car." }, { "title": "Pacific Coast Highway Drive 2013", "url": "/2013/04/pacific-coast-highway-drive-2013/", "categories": "General Thoughts", "tags": "events, ncdmc, drives, photo", "date": "2013-04-30 16:44:51 -0700", "snippet": "This is a big one! Over the past weekend a bunch of owners took a long (the longest ever for many of us) trip way up the PCH (CA Route 1), making it as far as Ft. Bragg before coming back down. Here’s a map of the route:The day started out with the 4 of us (me and Kate, Stephen and Debi, David and Heather and Clint flying solo) meeting up at my office in Fairfield. From there we drove out to the coast – first stop: Goat Rock Beach.True ’80s kids will recognize this as the setting of the final scene in The Goonies.David, climbing Goat Rock. Wayyyy off in the distance.Kind of a neat crushed old excavator we found laying on the beach. It looks like it had tumbled off the high rock many, many years ago and just been left. It was huge.Then it was off to lunch in Jenner, a microscopic town with literally one restaurant. But it ended up being a good one.After lunch we backtracked a bit to visit an abandoned DeLorean in the woods. There has been a lot of rumor and speculation around this car for years. Nearest we can tell it is owned by a hoarder (based on the condition of the surrounding property) and all attempts to contact the person and recover/rescue this car have failed. So we periodically just like to check on it and see how things are going. It’s got some very good looking stainless left on it still, but the interior has been deteriorating over the years, and a full decade of forest-floor overgrowth hasn’t done the frame any favors. It may be beyond salvage but that doesn’t mean it doesn’t deserve a visit now and then just to pay respect.This is the view from the street. This roadway is in the absolute dead center of nowhere, miles from anything. You’d never know there was even a house back there, much less a buried car.And here she is, rotting under the weight of a decade of tree droppings. The louvers are crushed under the weight and the passenger side rear quarter glass is shattered (it wasn’t the last time one of us visited). The car is up to the center caps in overgrowth and mulch, and has clearly been flooded at least once based on the mud stains on the bumpers.Panels all still line up very nicely, and a good powerwash would have this car shining like new, even if it may never run again.Grooved hood with no flap, so a late ’81. LFF still in great shape, not a ding on it.T-panel and louvers, what’s left of themA moment of silence for a fallen comrade…After this depressing visit, it was back on the road to finish our journey up to Mendocino, where we spent the night. Most of us stayed in town at little B&amp;amp;B places, and Clint continued a few miles on to Ft. Bragg to a regular hotel. We had dinner before parting ways for the evening. We found the Mendocino Cafe, which was so good it warrants mention by name. The town is kind of shabby and small, but this restaurant is a hidden gem for sure. Food was delicious and the place was hopping.Also interesting – the only gas station in Mendocino wanted $6.47 a gallon for 87 octane. Ft. Bragg was not in our original itinerary, but we had to get gas somewhere and sure weren’t paying that price for it. When we gassed up in Ft. Bragg I topped off a tiny bit (a cardinal sin in this car) and popped my fuel pump boot cover right off from the pressure. Gas pouring everywhere. Had to take apart the luggage compartment to access the fuel tank and hose everything down before continuing on. Minor inconvenience but I will definitely be upgrading that setup soon.The next morning we fueled up ourselves and the cars and headed back down 128. We had a brief pit stop at a vista point for some photos and to stretch our legs:David and Heather posing for a pictureClint the badassGroup shotHere’s meStephen and Debi. We had never spent time with Debi before and now I miss her already.Me and Kate. Someone left the flash on for this photo… oh wellWhose idea was this?For those of you who care more about the nature, here it is….After our stop on the coast we started tearing through the heavily forested 128 corridor. Nothing but giant redwoods as far as the eye can see. It was truly amazing.This was a state park. They wanted $8 per car to come in (even though all we wanted was a few pictures) – which most of us were OK with. But David put up a stink and got the park rangers all worked up 🙂 Eventually we just paid $4 each (though not David!) and came in to get these shots. A little drama – Stephen’s clutch started slipping in the woods, Clint backed into a boulder and David hit a squirrel, though all cars, the rodent and the boulder were unharmed.A few miles later my own clutch started slipping too. It seems that the extended use and heavy clutching/engine braking of the mountainous drive had brought to light a flaw in the adjustable clutch master linkage that both Stephen and I have installed. Mine will be gone by the end of the week. Not sure what his plans are.After a few hours of beautiful scenery, we rejoined 101 and entered Healdsburg, our final stop before heading home. We walked around a bit, got some lunch and some ice cream, and then David and Heather headed home while the rest of us went to our old haunt, Williamson Wines. After some wine and cheese, we all hit the road and called it a day.The remaining trip was uneventful save a major accident on the 37 bridge that had shut down both lanes and turned the whole road into a parking lot. Harrowing to be in uphill bumper to bumper traffic with a slipping clutch.That’s that! The next event is the UBSCC Car Show in Dixon, and then at the end of May my motor is coming out again to revisit some oil leaks. I will probably also replace the radiator and fuel pump while it’s out." }, { "title": "Picnic Day 2013", "url": "/2013/04/picnic-day-2013/", "categories": "General Thoughts", "tags": "events, picnicday, ncdmc, photo, drives, video", "date": "2013-04-21 16:00:43 -0700", "snippet": "Time again for what’s becoming an NCDMC tradition!

I got top grade speakers in all 4 corners, but because of the sizes (3.5″ round up front and 6×9″ in the rear) they have always lacked bass. I had to enable a high pass filter on them just to stop all the distortion, which means the overall audio quality was definitely lacking.Well, enter this little gem made by DMC California.It’s a Kicker 8″ sub in a custom designed box that fits into the locking cubby behind the driver’s seat. And what’s going to drive it?This JL Audio amp is top of the line in its class. I spent a lot of time researching before I chose it, and learned a lot about Class D amplifier theory in the process. This type of amplifier is cool because it reclaims unused power that would normally be expended as heat and reuses it when needed for sound. That means the amplifier stays cool, draws less power, and is more reliable. All good things – especially the ability to stay cool, because of where I ended up having to put it.Originally, my plan was to mount the amplifier to the back of the speaker box like this:But, unfortunately that won’t work. The box is deeper than I was told, and the combined unit won’t fit in the cubby.So, plan B. I removed the rear parcel shelf wall – just a thin sheet of plywood covered in carpet. It’s supported by two vertical metal strips and buts up against a thick foam pad, then the firewall to the engine. I just drilled four holes through the wood (but not the carpet,) pushed some screws through from underneath the carpet and bolted the amplifier to it.Next, I had to run the wiring. Because of how close the install was to the battery, I opted to power the amp straight from it. The 12v cable went right to the battery cut-off switchOf course, a dedicated fuse was installed in the 12v wire right at the switchAnd the ground cable went straight to the ground post on the batteryThen the signal wires – speaker wire through the engine computer compartment to the sub enclosure, and remote turn-on and audio inputs under the carpet up to the head unit.Of course, to run all of this, the whole interior had to come out – yet again!Here is the wiring all installed and dressed back.So right around now I decided to test the setup before I started putting everything back together. Imagine my dismay when the sub put out exactly zero audio. I spent two days testing, checking, re-testing and re-checking the wiring only to eventually discover that I had accidentally turned the input sensitivity control on the JL amp all the way down, thinking it was all the way up. Oops.With that problem solved, I started calibrating the new equipment. I downloaded some 50hz unattenuated sine wave tones and dialed in the filters and input sensitivity to the correct voltage for the driver. I used an old home audio spectrum analyzer to verify that the filter on the amplifier was set correctly for the bandpass filters in the head unit.Once that was done, it was a matter of cutting out a section of the thick foam padding behind the parcel shelf. This was partly to make a little more space for the amplifier to breathe and partly to keep it from getting covered in the sticky adhesive that the rubber mat was coated in. A while back I covered the entire interior of the car in Dynamat to deaden sound, so the foam was more or less redundant at this point anyway.Then it was time to reinstall the wall, sit back and enjoy the music!The best part about this whole setup is that besides the speaker itself, the entire installation is completely invisible. And you can’t see the speaker unless you flip the driver’s seat forward anyway." }, { "title": "Muffler coating", "url": "/2013/03/muffler-coating/", "categories": "General Thoughts", "tags": "restoration, repair, exhaust, photo, ncdmc", "date": "2013-03-11 21:21:30 -0700", "snippet": "So a bunch of the local owners got together and had our mufflers ceramic coated at a local shop in Sacramento. Shameless plug for this place since they did a really great job and turned the parts around fast – https://www.powdercoat-it.com/Anyway, the car has been off the road for two weeks. I picked up my muffler from Clint’s place on Sunday and installed it tonight. What a huge difference!! Here are some photos.You can see how corroded and heat damaged it had gotten. These mufflers put up with a LOT of shit, as they are stuck with ambient engine heat as well as exhaust gas that has had no chance to cool off as it moves from the front of the car. Hot. Very hot.Also, mine wasn’t the only one that looked like this. I managed to round up 4 other local owners who were interested in the same treatment. Every muffler looks more or less the same – corroded and heat damaged in the middle and around the pipes and more or less clean at the edges. You can really see where the heat concentrates in this design. The only one that didn’t look like total crap was Stephen’s, which is only because he had already painted it once… but the paint wasn’t holding up.So the coating shop has a multi-step process to ensure a perfect job. They degrease the parts thoroughly, then bake them to allow any impurities to outgas and come to the surface. Then they sandblast the part, bake it again, spray on the ceramic coating and bake it one more time. The results are astonishing.Only problem was that they had (at our request) masked off the tips so they didn’t get coated or blasted. This meant I had to clean all the corrosion and heat damage off by hand. Here’s how it went:As you can see, they were pretty tarnished and discolored. I taped off the coated section and polished them up with some Eagle One Never Dull and a Scotch-Brite pad. The result is a brushed finish that matches the car’s exterior beautifully and certainly looks better than the burned orange metal did.Here’s how it looks installed on the car!Anyway, I buttoned everything back up and took a spin. The exhaust seals MUCH better than it did before, thanks to a new stainless band clamp I used instead of the stock U-bolt.The downside is that while I was under the car (first time in months) I noticed that something is definitely still throwing oil. Not sure what – but it seems to be coming from the back of the motor. Main seal again? Who knows. We will have to pull the motor again to figure it out.I also got some more surprises in the mail today – the rest of the parts to finally get my subwoofer installed. That will be tomorrow’s project.

On Saturday I stopped by Clint’s place and installed the new fusebox I got for him. His car’s electrical system has always been a little weird, and while everything was more or less working it had that air of ‘could be better’ about it. Plus, a lot of his fuses were visibly melted and overrated. Plus he has a weird stumbling in his fuel system that we haven’t been able to track down yet.Anyway, the end result of 8 hours laying on my side on the passenger’s side floor turned this:Into this:There are still some loose wires here and there from the door lock mods and door poppers that he installed, but the fusebox is in brand new condition, all of the relays have been replaced, socket terminals were cleaned and tightened up, and the main harness re-wrapped. Every terminal in the fusebox was cut off, the wire ends cleaned and sanded to perfect copper, and then new terminals crimped and soldered on.Some of the old terminals in the original fusebox were very dangerous, like this one for one of the engine management circuits:You can see that the wires were barely hanging on, with many strands not even attached to the terminal. Lots of exposed copper, oxidized terminal ends, and melted/burned plastic fused to the contacts. How some of this stuff was even working at all is a mystery to me. Since many of the fuses that were showing this kind of decay were the ones responsible for the fuel pump and other engine control systems, we have high hopes that some of the strange fuel system glitches will be resolved or at least reduced when the motor is back together!As for my own car, there hasn’t been much to do lately! I took advantage of some free time this weekend to remove the windshield cowl and install some wire mesh over the fresh air intake opening. It’s a giant 12″x4″ cutout under the wiper blades with basically nothing to stop dirt, debris, leaves, etc from getting inside and collecting in the evaporator box. I cleaned the box last year and didn’t find much crud, but when I cleaned Clint’s it was like a compost heap inside. That was enough to motivate me to install this fix.Here’s the cowl, ready to remove:After removing it, there was plenty of crud to clean up.Some scrubbing bubbles made short work of all the filthHere’s what the huge opening looks like. No wonder stuff falls in there!A cheap ventilation screen from Lowes, with a rough pattern of the opening underneath itAfter trimming the screen to fit, some RTV holds it in placeWith the cowling reinstalled, the fix is completely invisible.

The main goal was to help him tear his motor down for its first VOD job in 13 years. Given how pristine his car is everywhere else, we went in with really high hopes for a smooth and easy job. And we weren’t disappointed – everything came apart very easy, with no broken bolts or difficulty at all.What we weren’t prepared for, though…A whole colony of snails had taken up residence in his valley. I can’t even fathom how they would have gotten there – they would have had to climb up from the ground, over the wheels and through the cradle to the motor. Where they got well and truly cooked. We all had a good laugh – “my car may not be as pretty as yours, but at least my engine wasn’t full of SNAILS!”We also had a chance to meet Ryan, a new owner in the area. He just bought his car a few months ago and was eager to have us all look it over. It’s a very nice ’81 grey auto, and I had a chance to drive it. It ran very nicely but needs some brake work, along with some other things like a roof box reinforcement, torsion bar adjustment, and some various odds and ends. A good solid starting point for a really nice project. We will be meeting up again at his place in a few weeks.I also located (with some help from friends on the forum) a local shop that will ceramic coat our mufflers. 5 of us are planning to have this done for cosmetic and heat management purposes. More on that as it develops.This weekend I’ll be at Clint’s place working on his electrical system – we are hoping to get the fusebox replaced and the electrical compartment cleaned up.As for my own car, Clint put a new outer door seal on the driver’s side for me and I started mounting my new stainless side sill letters!Side sill in original conditionStainless letters imported from the UKMounted up!Adds some much needed pop to the sills.

We got the car on stands, removed all 4 calipers, all 4 flex lines, the master cylinder and the front rotors. Got the rotors turned at a local shop while we scrubbed and rebuilt all 4 calipers. New pistons, seals, pads and shims all around. Stainless flex lines at all four corners. Brand new master cylinder. 36 man hours between the three of us, but we ultimately did a hell of a job in one day. I really enjoy working on the brakes on this car. They’re so simple – nothing but mindless wrenching.

But I had been lucky, up until a few weeks ago when the driver’s side motor started clicking. This generally indicates imminent doom, but I decided to tempt fate and leave it be for now.Since it was such a nice day yesterday, I decided to take a spin around town. Being a nice day, I also decided to put down my windows – as people often do. I thought “one more use won’t kill me”How wrong I was. The window lowered about 1/4th of the way and then there was a terrible sound of splintering plastic as it dropped all the way to the bottom of the door. Sigh….The worst part is that the price for the regulators recently jumped a huge amount. The DMC vendors sell them for about $300 each side, while the manufacturer had been selling them directly for about $319 for the set of two. But in the last six months the price jumped to almost $500 for the pair! I really wish I hadn’t held off on fixing these. But a phone call to the manufacturer (A1 Electric) and a little schmoozing netted me a bit of a discount. Not quite back to the old price but still a bit of a savings that I was glad to have. The new motors should be here early next week. I only plan to do the driver’s side right now since working inside these doors is a real pain in the butt.Here’s a photo of what’s left of my original regulator – notice the cheap plastic elbow and worm gear guide. The elbow had snapped and the worm gear had coiled up at the bottom of the door as the window came down. The breaking plastic noise was a combination of the elbow snapping and the (also plastic) gears inside the mechanism coming apart. Fortunately the window itself, and more importantly the carrier are still just fine.And a shot of all the dismantled door and interior parts… yet again…More updates to come as the parts arrive…" }, { "title": "Fuel problems resolved!", "url": "/2012/12/fuel-problems-resolved/", "categories": "General Thoughts", "tags": "restoration, repair, fuel, photo", "date": "2012-12-12 20:00:29 -0800", "snippet": "So after troubleshooting on my own for days – including tearing the whole top half of the motor off – Clint finally came over with his car and we compared some test results.

There was voltage on the harness and a correct dwell reading. What could be going on?We eventually found that while the harness was carrying *voltage*, it was not carrying any *current*. Bizarre. A few more hours of ripping the car apart led us to discover that one of the two pins in the bulkhead connector feeding the frequency valve had a marginal connection. But it couldn’t just be a simple one, oh no… it had to be the crimp from the pin to the wire from behind the engine compartment wall.Ultimately hours of troubleshooting and ripping out the interior led to a 30 second solder job which corrected the issue completely and hopefully permanently.

This is very strange as this part is well known for reliability. But all signs point right to it. For those who don’t know, this computer takes input from various switches and sensors throughout the engine to run an electronic valve that adjusts the amount of fuel that enters the mechanical fuel distributor. That valve is not functioning, so the air-fuel ratio is completely screwed up which is leading to the extremely poor running condition.Fortunately a great guy on DMCTalk stepped up and offered to send me a spare computer he has laying around.

Perfect lines around the roof and seals, and a perfect color match to the slightly faded (and all but irreplaceable) sunvisors. You can also see my fancy new dome light. Clint in the background, nonchalantly taking a phone call like a badass.Some more detail on the rear board. I epoxied an aluminum bar to the underside of this one, which we wrapped the fabric over. This gives the rear end of it (closest to the window) a lot more strength and it is straight as an arrow now, instead of sagging in the middle.Some more detail on the forward board. You can also see the driver’s side door board, newly covered as well.So now with my doors supported properly, cold start issues fixed, headliners fully installed and the weather finally cooling off – we might be able to start driving again!" }, { "title": "Quick photo update", "url": "/2012/08/quick-photo-update/", "categories": "General Thoughts", "tags": "restoration, repair, electrical, body, photo", "date": "2012-08-27 20:01:35 -0700", "snippet": "Just a couple quick photos.My old and new thermotime switches.

Over the last week I’ve been tracking down a cold start issue with the engine. It was taking lots and lots of cranking to get it started when it was completely cold and/or it had sat for a few days. After pulling the cold start valve and putting it in a glass jar, I confirmed that it was not spraying fuel. The function of this valve is to supply a metered spray of gas directly into the intake manifold during cranking to allow the car to start easier. There is a temperature-sensitive switch in the thermostat housing that governs the function of the injector. After days and days of troubleshooting I determined that this switch was bad. Replacing it was a 10 minute job and now the motor turns over quickly and easily again.But during the troubleshooting, I was rooting around in the relay compartment and heard an odd noise. It turned out that the main relay had developed a loose base and the slightest touch would cause the car to come to life as though the ignition key had been turned on. Dangerous and disconcerting. So I replaced that relay as well. Funny thing – everyone says that this particular part never goes bad. Lucky me to have it fail….&amp;lt;/param&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/param&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/param&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/param&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/embed&amp;gt;I also installed the driver’s side door strut bracket, recently upgraded by Byrne. No more flex in the bracket with weight on the stud, and the door stands about 6″ taller than before. Very pleased about that.Now I just have to install the passenger side bracket and I can reinstall the headliners. I have also discovered that the differential adjusting nut is probably on too tight (tolerances must have changed when the transmission case halves were split) and needs to be loosened to eliminate an annoying whine from the drivetrain at speed.More to come…." }, { "title": "Smog saga", "url": "/2012/08/smog-saga/", "categories": "General Thoughts", "tags": "restoration, repair, engine, photo, cooling", "date": "2012-08-17 08:33:21 -0700", "snippet": "With the car all back together and running again, it was time to get my smog check done. I had asked the place in town where I take the daily drivers if they would do it, and they said no – we don’t know what to look for on the visual inspection. Plus it will cost $120 because of the enhanced checks required on a car this old with no OBD (or other) onboard diagnostics.So I took it up to Sacramento instead, to the shop where Clint brings his. The guy was very cool, respectful of the car and quick about the inspection. It passed with flying colors, coming in not only dramatically below the high marks, but significantly below average. What a load off!Only problem was that with the 106 degree weather, a long drive up from Vacaville, idling for 20 minutes in the parking lot of the test station, and the dyno run – the temps really started climbing. When we left the test station to check out a discount metal warehouse nearby, I was sitting right at 220. I made the drive back to Clint’s place with the A/C off and heater going full blast (106 outside, remember…) to keep things cool. After a few hours cooling off in Clint’s garage, it was safe to drive home and stayed cool the whole way. It didn’t hurt that the ambient temperature went down dramatically in the evening.Not quite sure why it got so warm, as the water pump is working, the system holds pressure and isn’t leaking, the fans are working, etc. I think perhaps overuse of the A/C due to the high outside temp was killing the radiator’s efficiency. I may investigate a new radiator this year. I don’t believe mine is original, but it is quite old.This week I’ve put some vinyl tubing over the torsion bars to protect them from rubbing on the door hinge and eliminated a buzzing noise from where the T panel joins the windshield header. Just needed some new foam underneath to shim it up. I also tracked down a clunking noise from the rear end – it turned out to be my jug of coolant in the frunk banging around. The fiberglass tub can really mask where noises are coming from.Tonight I’m going to make a jumper to eliminate my dashboard rheostat (my lights are all LED, so having a resistive dimmer is just silly and causes them to go out sometimes) and maybe take another drive. Just waiting for my new, new, new, new door strut brackets to come and then I can put everything back together!" }, { "title": "All back together!", "url": "/2012/08/all-back-together/", "categories": "General Thoughts", "tags": "restoration, repair, engine, electrical, photo", "date": "2012-08-10 21:24:59 -0700", "snippet": "So after the drama last week, I got the motor all put back together and refilled with coolant. Pressure tested just fine. Hosed down the engine compartment, frame and body where the coolant had collected and decided to take another drive.New problem: it’s just cranking and cranking and cranking and not starting. Eventually with enough cranking and pumping the throttle, it sputters to life. Great, now something is wrong with the cold start system. Fine, whatever – it’s running. Got on the road and realized my voltmeter was reading about a full volt low, and that the battery light was flickering like crazy. Now what?? Washed the car properly since the cursory hose-down had left it covered in hard water spots. Protip: plain, undiluted white vinegar is amazing for taking hard water off the stainless. Just wet down the whole car and rub gently with a microfiber towel, then wash it as usual immediately after (to eliminate the terrible smell.)Last night I determined that the problem with the cold start system was just loose or dirty/corroded connections on the cold start valve and the thermotime switch. I pulled the connectors off, cleaned them, made sure they were making good contact and reinstalled them. Now the engine is turning over fine cold. On to the alternator.The alt is very new, less than 18 months old. It had always worked fine but occasionally I would have to pull off the connector to the regulator and re-seat it to get the regulator to excite before starting the car. So this afternoon I re-tensioned the belt on the alternator and removed the wiring from the starter and alternator so I could solder a new connector on to the regulator wire. Well, when I say “new,” I mean that I put the 30 year old factory connector back and removed the 18 month old one. The original one seemed to have better weather packing and definitely had thicker wires. After reconnecting everything – voila! Flashing battery light is gone and the voltage is nice and steady at 14v even with the A/C, radiator fans, stereo and headlights on. Can’t beat that.So now for another drive, this time on the highway. Drove up to Winters, which is just 2 exits on 505 and a nice easy drive; not to mention a fun little town to cruise. I was at a stoplight downtown, in the left turn lane and an older gent in a slammed Suburban pulls up next to me. I see him hang out of his window and start shouting at me and gesturing wildly. Great, I thought – either my motor is on fire or I’m about to get yet another lame ass joke. I roll down the window since it’s obvious that I saw him.“HEY, YOU NEED A REPAIR MANUAL FOR THAT THING?”harr harr harr. “No, it’s running just fine, thanks”“NO, SERIOUSLY – FOLLOW ME!”What the hell, I think. It’s a busy night on the street and I doubt he’s going to murder me with his grandkids in the car. I follow him about 500 yards to his house, where he gets out and proceeds to tell me all about how he used to have a DeLorean but got into trucks in the 90’s, etc. etc.“Hold on, I have something for you” and disappears inside the garage. 30 seconds later he comes out with these.Original and complete 30+ year old service and parts manuals!Turns out he really DID used to have one! He was very knowledgeable and an overall very nice guy.So what started as an incorrect assumption and anticipation of a lame joke turned out to be a pretty cool experience!Anyway, tomorrow it’s up to Sacramento to attempt to smog and hang out with David and Clint for the afternoon." }, { "title": "A mixed bag this weekend", "url": "/2012/07/a-mixed-bag-this-weekend/", "categories": "General Thoughts", "tags": "restoration, repair, engine, transmission, body, photo", "date": "2012-07-29 18:15:13 -0700", "snippet": "Clint came by Saturday morning as promised to get the clutch and transmission installed at last.The clutch kit went in beautifully.The transmission was a bit of a challenge to get lifted into place, however. We ultimately had to remove the hard coolant pipes from the lower half of the engine to the center of the car to make room. An hour or two of swearing and a bound up transmission jack later, the unit was reinstalled and we were ready to do all the little cleanup tasks. We reconnected the clutch and bled the system again and then spent another hour adjusting the shift linkage and crossgate cables. It was worth the effort as now the shifts are extremely precise.By 5:30, we had everything back together and in excellent working order. Here’s a shot of my car, waiting for Clint to pull out for our shakedown cruise.The cruise went spectacularly. We took a drive around my favorite back roads in Vacaville farm country. Everything seemed fine, so Clint packed his things and took off. I spent a half hour or so straightening up the garage so I could pull the car in easily, then took off for another short drive. The intention was to go get some dinner to celebrate a job well done. But that was not to be. As I pulled into my parking spot, the engine bay filled with a massive cloud of steam. I parked and shut the motor off. Opening the hood I found that literally every inch of the motor was coated in coolant and the bottle was bone dry. What the hell?! I bought a case of bottled water at BevMo and started pouring it into the bottle, but everything instantly dumped out the bottom again. The sun was setting and the temperature gauge was climbing rapidly, so I had no choice but to call a tow truck in shame. I’ve never called one before and hope never to do it again. Fortunately I was less than 2 miles from home, so it could have been worse.Arriving home, I immediately put the car on stands and investigated the issue. It only took 30 seconds with proper light and access to the bottom of the car to discover that the brand new heater control valve I installed in May had snapped in half. Well that’s just great.Fortunately I was able to find a crossover replacement at O’Reilly and get it installed in only about an hour. The valve that broke cost me $50 (since it included new hoses), and a brand new OEM one would have cost $20. The one I bought to replace the broken one was $40. Sigh. Here’s a photo of the three valves – the nasty one on top is the OEM valve, which lasted 30 some odd years and aside from being ugly, was working fine. The large one to the left is the new replacement, and the one to the right is the broken one.So, repairs completed and the coolant system refilled and re-pressure tested, I was ready for another test drive. It went well – no overheating or cooling issues. Transmission and shift linkage still feel excellent, but the motor had a bit of a jerky hesitation to it. I’m hoping that some coolant just found its way into the plug wells and will burn off. Arriving home, I sprayed down the motor and engine compartment to get all the sticky coolant off everything and it’s drying in the sun now. In another hour or so I’ll go for another quick drive and see if it still feels jerky.Sigh. Long weekend.

Covered the entire interior tub; floors, footwells, the transmission tunnel, firewall, rear deck, battery box and wheel wells. This made a huge difference in highway noise, road noise, and engine noise. It also gave me a chance to do a bunch of other interior work I had wanted to do. This installation took several days of scraping, cleaning, and precise cutting and forming of the Dynamat sheets.– Finally installed the new passenger side rear speaker– Shampooed every inch of carpeting– Tapped into the lights master switch to install a secondary relay. In the factory wiring configuration, the switch handles the full current of the headlights – but isn’t well suited for the task. The plastic internals melt. In this new configuration, the relay handles the current and the switch won’t melt.– Re-stretched and glued the vinyl on the driver’s side interior quarter panel. 30 years of entering and exiting the car had left it unglued and ripply. It looks like new now.– Re-epoxied the driver’s side upper seatbelt anchor bolt into the body so it doesn’t spin– Removed, cleaned, and re-adhered the driver’s side quarter panel louver– Repaired the seatbelt warning switch– Removed the steering column and shaft– Replaced the failed rubber steering column bushing with a lifetime one made of Delrin. This eliminated a huge amount of rattling over bumps and a ton of play in the steering– Replaced the seized steering shaft with a brand new stainless one from Martin at DeLorean Cars UK. This made the single biggest change in the car’s character of any one job I’ve done. The steering is so light and perfect now – feels almost as though it could be power assisted, but isn’t.– Removed, disassembled, and rebuild my lambda counter in an effort to eliminate my speedometer bounce. It was a long shot as I know the lower cable is to blame, but it was one more thing I wanted to do eventually anyway. It didn’t help.– Replaced all 4 springs with lowering springs. The front ones had been lowered by heating with a blowtorch and were collapsed and bent. The ones we took out were so frightening… this made the front end very squirrely around corners and over bumps. Now it feels solid as a rock and handles much better. Having the front suspension out also gave me the chance to inspect, lube and re-boot the lower ball joints.– Installed a new fiberglass radiator duct, which ports air from the front fascia over the radiator and through the fans. My car had been missing it since I got it. This thing was a huge pain in the ass, as the original one was made of flexible plastic But the replacement is very rigid. I had to do some cutting and sanding to get it to fit against the body tub. I also discovered that whatever impact had originally destroyed the original duct (probably a hard bottoming-out) had also bent the lower radiator support brackets, which needed to be bent back down for the duct to fit. And of course, a few uncooperative rivnuts had to be ripped out and replaced.– The duct install also gave me a chance to install a new powder coated rock screen, which, combined with the duct, had the added beneficial effect of completely straightening my lower lip spoiler (was previously very warped)– New radiator bushings (the old ones were incredibly dry rotted)– Cut new boot carpet backer boards (one for me and one for Clint)– Removed, cleaned and re-sealed my fuel sending unit to eliminate a gas odor– Drained and refilled the transmission oil – MTL Red Line is an amazing product!– Removed the old output shaft lip seals and replaced them with new double-lip ones that should never leak– Installed a new O-ring on the differential adjusting nut– Installed sleeves on the output shaft flanges to further guard against leaks– Cleaned the drive axles– Tore down and rebuilt the original door lock module to reduce standby current draw. This was accomplished by use of modern, high-gain Darlington transistors in place of the old and outdated ones. The high gain transistors were then accompanied by much higher rated resistors, which are what actually cut the current draw. Now my car can sit for days and still start on the first try without a battery tender.– Discovered that the mixture control screw couldn’t be adjusted because it was completely packed with crud. This necessitated a trip into the valley to remove, disassemble and clean the mixture unit. But, of course – the valley trip gave us a chance to do a bunch more stuff, like….– Cleaning up the coolant that had leaked from a loose water pump back hose, and fix the leak– Replace the heater control valve and hoses– Install my cooling system auto bleeder from Toby and Misty at DPNW– Pressure test the entire cooling system at 20psi and tighten anything that dripped– Install a new rocker cover gasket on the passenger side – the last one we did was leaking already. Got much better quality ones this time around– Install a clutch slave cylinder remote bleed fitting– With the mixture screw cleaned up and usable, finally set the mixture properly. No more gas smell and should hopefully pass smog when the time comes!Then yesterday was a tech session with the NCDMC crew in El Dorado. Thanks to them, I…– Adjusted the door torsion bars so the doors open themselves and actually stay up, a luxury I have not had since I got the car. What a difference that makes! It looked like mine had been dialed down by some amateur at some point, and it was a pretty hairy adjustment as some bolts were stripped. I probably also need slightly more powerful struts to maximize the travel, but it’s a whole world better already without them.After we adjusted my and Clint’s doors, all 6 of us took off for a cruise around El Dorado and Old Town Folsom. Lots of great, twisty roads and little towns up there to get some face time with the locals 🙂We also got a chance to meet a new local owner, David – who just moved to Lodi from Minnesota and should be a cool addition to the club. His car is very nice, but seems to have a ticking that we’ll have to help him investigate.That’s all for now… I’ll try and update more often so there can be more detail on each job. The next big task is going to be dropping the transmission and swapping the clutch, rear main seal, and doing a rebuild on the trans. But I’m in no huge rush…And as always, pics are in the gallery. Pics from the NCDMC meet are here." }, { "title": "Restoration, Log 19", "url": "/2012/01/restoration-log-19/", "categories": "General Thoughts, Legacy Restoration Log", "tags": "restoration, repair, electrical", "date": "2012-01-14 09:05:00 -0800", "snippet": "A quick post-holiday update. Because of the hectic holiday schedule, I haven’t done a whole ton of work on the car lately. Besides, it’s been too nice here to have her all ripped apart! 66 degrees, every day, for all of January so far? That’s driving weather.But, of course I can’t resist tackling little things here and there… so, I installed all my new solid state electronics from Dave McKeen. I got an RPM relay, fan fail detector, and dome light timer. The RPM relay is cool because he takes the original relay, guts it, and installs his custom designed circuitry inside the OEM case. So now I have a more reliable fuel system that primes every time at key-on, and I should never be stranded with a failed or overheated relay.The fan fail detector replaces the 3-blade jumper wire that was installed immediately after the car hit the streets in ’81. The original detector was meant to flash a light on the dashboard if a cooling fan went out, but in practice the detector was extremely failure prone itself and would actually cause the fans to die – with no indication on the dashboard. Great. This updated design from Dave provides individually fused links to each of the two fans, and restores/improves on the originally designed factory functionality.Then, the dome light timer. The original wiring had a simple resistor installed that would time the dome lights and dim them to off after the doors were closed. But this design doesn’t work with LID bulbs, which i have upgraded the dome lights to. The temporary workaround was to remove the resistor completely, But Dave’s timer is a real solution. Besides restoring the factory functionality of dimming the dome lights after the doors are closed, his design provides a fully programmable delay time as well as battery saver (lights off after 10 minutes) and parade (all courtesy lights flashing – cool while driving with the doors up in a parade!) modes.I also finally fixed the flickering lights behind the A/C panel. Turns out when I installed the sockets into the new radio mounting panel, I pushed them too far out. This was causing the bulbs to stick out and push on the A/C faceplate, and the pressure on the sockets was causing intermittent connection to the bulbs. Pulling the whole center console again (ugh) and wrapping each socket in a bit of electrical tape before reinstalling it limited how far it could push through and completely solved the flickering issue. An added benefit of this repair is that the HVAC faceplate now lines up better and sits flush.So those were my planned upgrades over the last few weeks. I also had an unplanned repair when a friend who shall remain nameless flopped into the passenger seat too hard and accidentally broke the armrest extension clean off the rear interior quarter panel. Fortunately I was able to fix it up better than new with a few well placed rivets, and the need to pull that panel off finally gave me a chance to install my last new speaker.Last weekend I also spent a day with Clint working on #1768. He designed some new Heim-jointed supports for the front lower control arms with the intent of improving handing. So, we spent Saturday in the shop fabricating the braces and getting them welded to the frame. The design still needs some tweaking but has a lot of promise. And as an added bonus, while i was there he removed the outer throttle spool return spring from my throttle body – which has improved throttle response about a million times, and it’s now much easier to accelerate and maintain highway speeds. Best free mod i’ve done yet!As always, pictures are in the gallery." }, { "title": "Restoration, Log 18", "url": "/2011/12/restoration-log-18/", "categories": "General Thoughts, Legacy Restoration Log", "tags": "restoration, repair, body, brakes", "date": "2011-12-04 16:57:00 -0800", "snippet": "Another update. A lot of work this last couple of weeks!I finally got the new lock cylinders keyed properly and ready to install. It was a difficult process, as it required removing the old ones – which were never meant to be taken back out of the door. This meant that the inner retaining ring that held the cylinder into the door skin needed to be snapped from the inside to destroy it enough to slip out. Who knew removal of anything via destruction could be so difficult? But that was only the beginning. After removing the old locks, the door skins need to be modified to accept the new ones. This requires clipping a jig to the hole and filing out small slots with a diamond file. It required significant psychological effort for me to do that to the skins… but eventually I did it. Then I had to use some sandpaper and a blending pad to remove the circle patterns from under the old locks – the new ones are slightly smaller. That took an hour or two as well. Anyway, the new cylinders are great – much more positive, the key fits better, and should be much more reliable and easy to remove/replace in the future.I also finally broke down and purchased new floor mats. They are replicas of the original dealer equipment and just look bloody phenomenal in the car. It makes a huge difference in the feeling of the interior over the nasty one-size rubber ones I had in there previously. The DMC mats were really expensive but are amazingly high quality, thick pile carpet with thick rubber backing. They are cut to fit the footwells with incredible tolerance. Can you tell I love them?Next, I installed a hidden iPod in the center console. The new head unit I installed has full iPod control, and I was tired of having a cable plugged into the front. I ran the USB cable from the back of the head unit, up through the center console and to an iPod mini that I attached to the bottom of the ashtray with Velcro. It fits perfectly – invisible during normal operation, perfect functionality, and easy to take in and out of the car to change music. Very pleased with that.The machine shop here in town has also been working on my prototype part – I got my first sample on Tuesday, but the size wasn’t exactly perfect. They’re making me a new one, so stay tuned again.Lastly, Clint and I spent all day Saturday rebuilding the brakes on the car. We stripped off the calipers, rebuilt them with all new seals and pistons, flushed the lines and master cylinder, installed all new pads with every conceivable anti-squeal technology, and capped it off with stainless brake lines and fresh fluid. We found one seized piston and one blocked line, and it would appear that the rear pads were original to the car. It took us almost 12 hours, but we got the whole job done and everything works great. I was also able to take the opportunity to do some cleaning on the suspension bits. Scraped off almost a half-inch thick coating of grime and grease on the control arms. After finishing the last wheel, we went out for a test drive through an industrial park near the house. Since it was so late, there was no one there – which made it a perfect place for a few 70-0 panic stops to break things in. Stopping distance is much improved, the squealing is gone, and pedal feel is much better. Worth every penny! But, when we got back from our test drive, I pulled into the garage and parked like i always do, but was alarmed when i pulled the parking brake and heard a loud clang as the lever swung wildly up. Somehow the parking brake cables got loose from the handle. Fixed that this morning and the car’s back to its normal, perfect self.As always, pictures are in the gallery Stay tuned for more…" }, { "title": "Restoration, Log 17", "url": "/2011/11/restoration-log-17/", "categories": "General Thoughts, Legacy Restoration Log", "tags": "restoration, repair, electrical, events", "date": "2011-11-04 12:54:00 -0700", "snippet": "The onset of winter and other responsibilities have been slowing me up the last few weeks, but that didn’t stop me from getting a bunch more work done.I got my door locks working – I have power locks for the first time since i got the car! The weight difference between the old solenoids and the new linear actuators is incredible. The old solenoids were 27.75 oz and the new actuators are only 5.5 oz. Since the solenoids are way at the farthest point from the fulcrum of the door, that weight difference made a huge impact on the doors’ opening ability – they stay up a lot better now. And the power functionality is great.I was planning on putting my new external door locks in as well, but due to some confusion over the key code, they were made wrong and I am waiting for the replacements to arrive.Next, I installed my new convex side mirror glass and new caps on the rear arm rest sections. Both make a big difference – the normal mirrors made it impossible to see anything behind the car, so this was a great improvement to safety, particularly on the highway. The arm rest caps made a big cosmetic difference too, as the leather was all worn out on the very edge.Also swapped the pushbutton switch I made for the integrated garage door opener with a spare power window switch that the arrows wore off of. this give it a much more stock and invisible look.In other news; Clint and I showed at a cruise night in Davis, which was a lot of fun – people there were blown away to see our cars parked next to each other.I’ve also started working with another guy on the forum on a new custom part for the car. Stay tuned for info on that; I’m going to drop off our plans and specs at the machine shop next week to get a prototype put together.That’s all for now… I’ve started buying the parts for the winter’s big jobs – a major transmission overhaul and a complete replacement of the entire brake system.As always, pictures are in the gallery." }, { "title": "Restoration, Log 16", "url": "/2011/10/restoration-log-16/", "categories": "General Thoughts, Legacy Restoration Log", "tags": "restoration, repair, electrical, audio, events", "date": "2011-10-08 17:20:00 -0700", "snippet": "Another update. Some good stuff since the last one, namely the new stereo. I replaced the speakers all around and put in a new head unit, which required an entirely new center stack to accommodate a modern deck.The rear speakers are Kenwood KFC-410Cs, the fronts are Infinity 329CFs. The new deck is a JVC KD-R820BT unit which has AM/FM/CD as well as Bluetooth, iPod and Pandora control. It’s a great unit because it has adjustable color settings, so I can customize it to match the rest of the interior lighting. The Bluetooth and iPod control is also great, as is the sound quality.I also installed the wiring required to install a subwoofer in my locking storage compartment behind the driver’s seat. I will get to that someday.There was some drama surrounding the stereo install when my first faceplate arrived from Houston all crushed and mangled. I don’t know what happened there, but they sent me a new one right away and it looks great. I was also very surprised to see a whole external amplifier rigged up to the tape deck behind the center console. It was just sitting on the center tunnel, not strapped or screwed down and certainly not connected well since half the speakers weren’t working. That’s all gone now and the DeLorean now has the best and most advanced stereo of all our cars.Also got my garage door opener installed – Ryan was able to get the fine soldering work done and I installed the module and modified dummy switch. So now I have a hidden/stock looking integrated garage door opener.Also, today was my first ever car show with 8BIT. I joined a bunch of the Northern California DeLorean Motor Club guys at the Cameron Park airpark for their 22nd annual Show n’ Shine. There were 6 DeLoreans there all told, and we were the stars of the show! The crowds were non-stop and it was a lot of fun. I learned a lot from the guys; they’ve all been owners much, much longer than me. The main points i took away are that my doors are in serious need of adjustment, but that my car is a really good condition early-VIN example. They are confident it will be a great restoration when all is said and done. They are even going to help me get the doors adjusted.To that end, I ordered a bunch of new door parts that I need to get installed so that the doors are their proper final weight before we adjust the torsion bars. Things like new key lock tumblers, new linear actuators to replace the solenoids, a digital keyless central locking system, and convex side mirrors.Besides a new flasher relay (for which, by the way, Napa auto parts EP-35 is a direct cross reference as long as you aren’t running LED turn signals) that’s it for now. As always, pictures of the recent progress are in the gallery. The pics from the cameron park show are here." }, { "title": "Restoration, Log 15", "url": "/2011/09/restoration-log-15/", "categories": "General Thoughts, Legacy Restoration Log", "tags": "restoration, repair, electrical, body, hvac, ac", "date": "2011-09-05 06:27:00 -0700", "snippet": "Been a while since the last update. Between our trip to NYC, camping, and Colleen getting sick, I haven’t had much time to post. But that doesn’t mean I haven’t had time to work on the car 🙂After finishing all the maintenance on the engine, I took a few quick road tests. It runs so happily now – smooth revs (even all the way to redline, when I chose to), quick acceleration, no hesitation or stumbling. It’s like a whole new car! The only issue i noticed was that at extremely high revs, the battery light would start flickering. Since it only happens at very high RPM, it must be a slipping belt. But I can’t tension it any further? I’m using the correct belt for the new alternator, but it must have stretched or something. It’s on the list…I did eventually find the leak in the A/C system – turned out it was a loose connection at the accumulator in the passenger wheel well. Of course, it was the worst possible connection to tighten down properly. That’s most likely why it was loose in the first place. I was able to get pretty fair access to it through the fuel tank/pump maintenance panel in the spare wheel well and tighten it down. Then a quick leak test, vacuum and charge and the A/C is cold and happy.I also installed the exterior caps over the seatbelt anchor bolts where they come through the body tub – gives a much cleaner look under the side sills. And new lug nuts all around – also much better looking.New ground cables are installed too. They are a two-piece design that grounds the battery to the transmission before the primary frame ground. The improved connection combined with the incredibly high quality of the new cables (especially in contrast to the original one) has made an amazing difference in the electrical system. The starter spins amazingly quickly, and the engine catches almost immediately. It starts almost as fast as my Acura now. Also, the voltage is higher and the RPM gauge has stopped acting up when there’s a lot of electrical load. 30 bucks well spent!Also finally completed my interior LED conversion. LEDs in the center console, HVAC panel, dashboard, external side markers and license plate lamps. The difference is spectacular – everything is bright and well lit, properly colored, and the drastically decreased power draw is a huge plus.Another project this past weekend was to construct a new seat back for the driver’s seat. The old one was broken and warped – it would fall off every time I sat down. I removed the leather outer skin, drilled out the rivets and made a template from the old hardboard. Then, with Bo’s help, we cut out the new template. I riveted the hardware back on and re-upholstered the back with the original leather skin after cleaning it. The result is stellar! It looks exactly like factory new and holds perfectly.The final project of note is my plan to integrate a garage door opener into the center console. I bought a small keychain sized opener, a project box, a DC jack and plug and a small pushbutton switch. I installed the circuitry from the opener into the project box and integrated the DC jack into the outside. Then, I put a hole in one of the dummy switches and installed the pushbutton, wired to the DC plug. This will allow me to route the cables easily and cleanly. The last thing remaining is for the DC jack to be soldered to the circuitry on the opener. Ryan is going to handle that part for me, since surface mount soldering is far outside my skill.And today, I reinstalled the lower engine cover catch so the release cable will work (and any old passer-by can’t just open my engine cover, LOL) as well as installing the ‘Handling by Lotus’ badge Clint gave me. And, a good exterior cleaning. Note to self: buy more foaming glass cleaner.pictures of all this fun are in the gallery!

Finally got the fuel filter tightened up, after two days of research and attempts. Turned out it was leaking at both ends; the banjo bolt wasn’t tight enough and the elbow fitting to the hard supply line from the tank was loose as well. Some petroleum-resistant teflon tape and a lot of back-breaking double wrenching got it all locked up tight. Not until after I was absolutely covered in gasoline though. Good times….The next challenge was getting the rear fascia back on. What a pain in the butt! That also took two afternoons and three or four attempts to get it on straight and so that everything closes properly – but I got it and it looks great.Then, it was time for the inaugural drive. I needed to warm up the engine and get coolant flowing so I could bleed the air out of the thermostat housing. The car runs and drives fabulously, it’s the little things that make all the difference. There’s more power on tap, it doesn’t hesitate so much, and runs a little quieter. Plus, the crankcase isn’t leaking anymore. Transmission still is a little bit leaky, but we’re getting there. Anyway, on the way home, the battery light started flickering on and off – low voltage? Now what?! Turned out the belt was just a little loose – I had planned to re-tension them after the first time out anyway, so that was an easy fix.Next up – the great coolant bleed. The coolant system on this car is a massive hassle. Run it up to temp, bleed a little, cool down, add coolant back to the header bottle, and start all over. I did that about 5 times, which took several hours – until I just gave up. Too much air in the system from being so wide open for a week. I went to AutoZone and rented a coolant system pressure tester – that let me pressurize, bleed, and re-pressurize the system without waiting for the thermostat to open or the header bottle to cool, and without the risk of running low on coolant or introducing new air into the system. It took about 40 minutes to get the whole system flushed out. I also ordered an auto-bleeding system from DeLorean Northwest that should keep the system free of air, now that i’ve got it all sealed up properly.I think she’s ready for some real road time now! Still have to do the oil change and chase down the leak in the A/C system, but there’s still plenty of weekends left in the summer.And of course, tons of pictures in the gallery." }, { "title": "Restoration, Log 13", "url": "/2011/07/restoration-log-13/", "categories": "General Thoughts, Legacy Restoration Log", "tags": "restoration, repair, electrical, hvac, ac", "date": "2011-07-13 01:36:00 -0700", "snippet": "Big update on this one. I got the alternator and taillight boards back and reinstalled successfully. The electrical system is back to normal and the taillights are working better than ever. I also put my new LED bulbs into the doors and engine/luggage compartments, and they look great! Now W want to do the rest of the interior lamps in led as well – dashboard, HVAC panel, dome lights… so much to do!I also got all my major service parts in, and started working on the installation. This started with taking off the rear fascia and bumper on Friday evening. Saturday morning, I headed to Clint’s shop and he tack welded the pulley on my new water pump to the shaft – he didn’t want to risk the steel pulley becoming loose down the line and coming off. This happened to him, so better safe than sorry I suppose. He also welded up a perfect little tool to knock the crankshaft main seal into place.Then, it was back to my garage, where we tore down the whole top end of the motor – took off the fuel distributor, intakes, valve covers and water pump. It all went pretty smoothly, with the exception of two bolts that sheared off when removing the Y-pipe under the intake manifold. One was removable cleanly, the other needed to be drilled out and the hole re-tapped 1mm larger. Not a big deal though, just inconvenient and annoying – fortunately.Ultimately, after two full days of cursing, busted knuckles and nearly 10 cans of Brakleen, we completed the rebuild. This included cleaning the valve covers, air intake manifold, fuel injection manifold and thermostat housing, painting the intake valley, installing a new water pump, thermostat and water hoses, replacing the rubber fuel lines with braided stainless ones, replacing the rubber vacuum lines with silicone ones, replacing the fuel filter, adjusting the valve lash, replacing the cylinder cover gaskets, replacing the main oil seal under the crankshaft pulley, new drive belts, a new distributor cap and rotor, new silicone plug wires, new plugs, a new ignition coil, a new air filter, moving all the electrical wiring from the top of the engine to under the intake manifold, and a new fuel filter.This all sounds good, until you realize that I haven’t talked about cranking the engine and driving off into the sunset. At about 11 pm on Monday, we finished putting the engine back together and went to try and start it. That was when we noticed that the new fuel filter i had installed was hemorrhaging gas all over the garage floor. Removing the stupid thing is no trivial task – takes about 30 minutes just to get it off, thanks to a very small work area under the trailing arm shield. Turned out i had used the wrong banjo bolt in the filter, so a quick replacement and we tried again. Still leaking! Much smaller this time, but not enough pressure exists in the system for the engine to fire. But by this time it was after midnight and I couldn’t take anymore. Then, as he was leaving, Clint noticed that two of the injectors were bubbling a tiny bit – the fuel bolts weren’t on tight enough.So, this evening I hope to try the filter *again*, re-tighten all the banjo bolts, and hopefully get her fired up. Then I just have to bleed the coolant, drive a few miles, re-tighten the drive belts, and do an oil change.On another note, before all this happened, the newly installed A/C system blew its charge. I have no idea where the leak is – nothing is obviously damaged or loose. So, i have to re-charge the system, inject tracer dye and hope we can find the issue. But of course that has to wait until the engine is working properly again…. stay tuned!As always, there is a wealth of photographic documentation in the gallery." }, { "title": "Restoration, Log 12", "url": "/2011/06/restoration-log-12/", "categories": "General Thoughts, Legacy Restoration Log", "tags": "restoration, repair, electrical", "date": "2011-06-17 15:23:00 -0700", "snippet": "Just a quick update: the car is out of commission and has been parked for about a week. A loose connection caused the new alternator to burn up (or perhaps vice-versa, I really have no idea) – but either way, the car’s dead in the water while the alternator is being rebuilt (or replaced if necessary) in Texas. On the up side, since she’s not going anywhere anyway, I am also having the taillight boards refurbished so I won’t have any more bulbs out.Before she died, we took advantage of a beautiful day in town to do some more interesting photos at the new college campus.

On a whim, I decided to investigate why the washer fluid didn’t spray. The bottle was intact, the hoses were fine, the switch worked and there was power at the harness… turned out the motor had rusted into a solid block. A new motor fixed the issue, and I boiled out the mold in the washer fluid bottle while I was at it.I also installed a new alternator – updating the original 80 amp with a Special-T 120 amp model. The difference in the car’s behavior was immediate – the idle is smoother, the A/C doesn’t impact other accessories, the starter turns over faster, and the battery is actually charging again. The only negative to that job is that I must have jostled something in the heater system when i was adjusting the wiring harness, as I now have a slow and localized coolant leak at the back of the engine. The most likely culprits are the hot water valve and the bleeder T assembly, which are of course virtually inaccessible. I’ll figure it out eventually…Also, today I spent a full 10 hours replacing the radiator fans. This completes my overhaul of the electrical system – replaced the original Smiths fans (which drew a whopping 60 amps – with an 80 amp alternator? sure, that makes sense) with a set of Special-T custom ones. These only draw 20 amps at inrush, and only 11 while running. Between the updated wiring, relays, fuses, alternator and grounds, it makes for a very happy and smooth-running car.As always, pictures are in the log. stay tuned for more!" }, { "title": "Restoration, Log 10", "url": "/2011/05/restoration-log-10/", "categories": "General Thoughts, Legacy Restoration Log", "tags": "restoration, repair, window, hvac, ac", "date": "2011-05-09 11:11:00 -0700", "snippet": "Big successes lately. After the travesty with the window dropping off the tracks, I regrouped and got everything back together. I even got up the nerve to replace all the rest of the door seals – inner, outer and lower on both sides. That went really well, except the inner driver’s side seal. I put the new one on and the door wouldn’t close anymore! It seems it’s a touch misaligned. That’s sad, because it closes so well – one more little nuance of these hand-made fiberglass body shells is that the tolerances were way less than perfect. I put the old seal back on, which was compressed and a little torn in one corner at the roofline, which allows the door to close properly. The tear isn’t going to be a problem now thanks to the new outer seals.Part of replacing the door seals was removing and repainting the windshield header panel and a-pillar trim. I didn’t get into a delorean to mess around with paint, so I pulled the panels off and brought them to a body shop in town. 70 bucks got them stripped and repainted, good as new. They look great!I also re-sealed the rubber isolating strips under the hood and sealed in the new outer window wipes with some black silicone, rebuilt another cv joint, got new wiper blades and started rebuilding my shift linkage. I put a new pivot bolt and nut in with new bushings and collars, which reduced the clanking noise and increased shift accuracy dramatically. I still have a few more bolts to do, but that will be a job for another day.The biggest news, however, was a trip up to Clint’s race shop in Sacramento yesterday. We spent 8 hours cutting out my old, nonfunctional A/C system and replacing every inch of it – hoses, compressor, o-rings, accumulator, fittings, switches, lube and refrigerant. And yes, literally cutting – the hoses run from the compressor in the engine bay to the condenser at the front by the radiator. They’re installed onto the frame before the body was attached. This means the options are either to detach and lift the body off to remove and run new hoses, or cut the old ones in half and run new style hoses with a splice in the middle. We chose option 2… it wasn’t a particularly hard job, but it took a lot of effort. At the end of the day though, the A/C was running perfectly – and blowing 29 degree air! It’s like driving a whole different car when I’m not sweating my ass off and struggling to get any airflow through the tiny windows.The efforts continue!" }, { "title": "Restoration, Log 9", "url": "/2011/05/restoration-log-9/", "categories": "General Thoughts, Legacy Restoration Log", "tags": "restoration, repair, window", "date": "2011-05-01 13:29:00 -0700", "snippet": "A frustrating day working on the D. I have been taking apart the doors to install new outer window wipes and put bits of vinyl tubing around the lock and latch rods where they clank into each other. The net result is a much quieter car – no metal on metal clanging on every bump. Worth it, really – until I started installing the outer wipe on the passenger side (the last step.)It was cut slightly wrong, which knocked the glass off its track on the front edge. The regulator system is fairly primitive but not that different from any modern car – with the exception that it’s nearly impossible to access anything due to the design of the doors.Eventually I figured out how to trim the front edge of the wipe and get the regulator re-assembled and the glass back in the tracks, but then I realized that the rear edge of it wasn’t sealing anymore. I spent two hours trying and trying and failing to get the rear edge to seal before I noticed – the regulator motor is laboring pretty hard, and when i am holding the power window switch, the dash lights are dimming. Not enough power?Started the engine, and the window seals fine. Argh!! As I write this, the car is still in pieces in the garage, because I’m frustrated and upset and that will only lead to me doing a less than perfect job in re-assembling and cleaning up, which is not acceptable. I will get back to it tonight or tomorrow maybe.On the plus side, the rattles in both doors are gone, the windows seal better than ever (need to get some black rtv silicone to seal in the new outer wipes, but no big deal) and all my new a/c parts arrived. The only thing I’m waiting for now is my vacuum pump and manifold gauges. I couldn’t find anyone to borrow them from so i decided to just buy a set, see how it goes, and flip them on eBay or Craigslist when I’m done. Maybe someone on the DeLorean forums will want them. Or maybe i’ll just keep them, you never know when they might come in handy. Either way, I’ll be properly equipped for the job at hand and that’s what matters.Now if you’ll excuse me, my hands are gushing blood from working inside these doors (knives are made from stainless too, you know)" }, { "title": "Restoration, Log 8", "url": "/2011/04/restoration-log-8/", "categories": "General Thoughts, Legacy Restoration Log", "tags": "restoration, repair, electrical", "date": "2011-04-21 17:13:00 -0700", "snippet": "Another huge victory today. I finally got the rest of my electrical system parts in and spent the last two days completely removing the breakers, relays and fuse block from the electrical compartment. I had to pull each pair out of the block, label it and then record the colors, orientation and block # in a spreadsheet. Then, I cut off all the barrel terminals, re-crimped new ones and re-labeled the pairs. Then, soldered all of the terminal joints to the wires and re-labeled the pairs a third time. Once all the soldering was done, I reinstalled the pairs into the fuse block, replaced the remaining breakers and re-installed all the relays.The net result of what added up to about 16 hours of hunching over the tiny and barely accessible electrical bay breathing solder fumes is a gorgeous new electrical bay with a fresh new fuse block in which nothing is melted or overrated. Everything is clean and neat and modernized, and should last another 30 years with no problem.Basically, I turned this into this. A huge improvement if you ask me…Now that the electrical system is modern and reliable, it’s time to focus on the A/C – before the summer heat hits us! So, I ordered all new hoses, a new compressor, a new accumulator and pressure switches, refrigerant, oils, seals… the whole deal. Clint and I will tear the old stuff out and replace it with a brand new R134a system next week sometime.

Sorry for the delayed updates, but I’ve been putting in so many hours on this thing that by the time I’m done in the evening it’s just time for bed. Anyway, here’s the new updates:– Started working on the window rattles when they’re down. Most of the issue comes from the fact that the inner felt wipes had completely decayed and dropped inside the door, and the outer wipe seals had gotten so hard with age that they were cracking and breaking. I fixed the inner wipes as the material was still fully usable, and ordered replacement outer wipes. I also need to install some sort of stop to keep the passenger side window from going so far down, as it goes about 1/4″ too far in the track which is causing more noise.– Replaced the engine bay light switch, so now I have a nice bright lamp when I open the engine cover– Replace the otterstat in the coolant pipe that activates the radiator cooling fans. The old otterstat was corroded so badly that it just ran the fans all the time, an unnecessary draw on the electrical system. Now they come on and off as needed. But, pulling the otterstat introduced air into the coolant lines so….– I bled and refilled the coolant. There was a *ton* of air in the system. Also, after bleeding the air and draining about a quart of coolant, I was about a gallon low. Yikes. Topped that off as well.– Replaced all the relays in the electrical compartment with brand spanking new tyco models– Fixed the mystery bolts behind the drivers’ side taillight. they simply held the fascia to the pontoon and were being interfered with by the bracket for the power antenna. I removed the fuel system charcoal canister and put new nuts on them.– Disconnected the power antenna as i don’t like how it looks when up, and i never listen to the radio anyway– Removed the old steering rack and tie rod ends and installed a brand new rack and ends. Clint did a huge amount of the work on this one, and I owe him one…– Front end alignment on the new rack– After the new rack went in, my steering wheel was upside down (1/2 turn off) – so we pulled it and realigned it. While it was off, we fixed the turn signal cancel function– Installed new trailing arm bolts. Well, one of them – after fighting with it for over an hour, we got it out and realized it was already an upgraded bolt. So we put the new one in since it was already out, and didn’t touch the other side. Maybe I will at some point just for fun?– Fixed the low tone horn. Only my high tone worked, and Clint had a spare original low-note one on his shelf. Installed it and everything is back to normal.So those are the successes. but, every DeLorean repair leads to the discovery of new issues, and here they are:– Output shaft seals on the transmission are weeping a bit. Enough that the side of the tranny is all gunked up, but not enough that there is active dripping. In fact, the seals may have been replaced already and the gunk just never cleaned up. A distinct lack of records from the previous owners does not help me figure this out, so I will probably just do the replacement anyway– The new cv joint that mike and i rebuilt and installed did not seal properly on one end and is throwing grease all over the underside of the car. I will need to cut that clamp off, re-pack it, and re-clamp it." }, { "title": "Restoration, Log 6", "url": "/2011/04/restoration-log-6/", "categories": "General Thoughts, Legacy Restoration Log", "tags": "restoration, repair, electrical", "date": "2011-04-10 08:44:00 -0700", "snippet": "A few more minor accomplishments and new issues to list out.I finally got my new power mirror switch in the mail and got it installed. The mirrors work! This is great news because now I will actually be able to see what I am doing when driving. Before, the mirrors were stuck in a useless position that left me with an even bigger blind spot.I also replaced the oil light sending unit, which was the main cause of the oil mess on the lower engine. However, now that it’s replaced it is possible that the front main seal is slowly leaking as well, so that’s a project for another day. I need to degrease the engine so I can track where the leak is coming from now – or if there’s even still a leak. The drips might just be oil that is already caked on heating up and dripping off after a drive – the quantity is very, very small and only happens after a drive, never when cold and parked.So that’s two more things off the list. Yesterday I went up to Clint’s place (another DeLorean owner in Sacramento) to help him tear down his plugs and wires and distributor with dielectric grease in an attempt to clear a pulsing tach signal. It didn’t help – so he probably needs a new pulse coil. But, when i was up there, we took turns driving each others cars. He tells me that I need to consider a new steering rack and a shift linkage overhaul. After driving his, he’s definitely right. It’s much easier to maneuver and much quieter to shift.I also discovered that my fuse box is starting to melt. This is a common issue on these cars, but I never really checked for it because everything is working so well. Turns out I am going to need to replace the fuse box, and while I’m at it will probably replace all the relays too. It won’t be hard for me as i’m pretty handy with a soldering iron, but it’s annoying. Small price to pay for a safer car, i guess." }, { "title": "Restoration, Log 5", "url": "/2011/04/restoration-log-5/", "categories": "General Thoughts, Legacy Restoration Log", "tags": "restoration, repair", "date": "2011-04-02 15:08:00 -0700", "snippet": "Another lengthy day of busted knuckles. today’s list of accomplishments includes:– Repairing the driver’s side seat back. I’m not sure if this fix is going to hold but for now it seems ok– Re-attached the two halves of the steering column to one another (they were separated for some reason)– Re-attached the leather cowl that covers the telescoping portion of the steering shaft– Fixed the headlight stalk so that my always-on brights work properly now (before, they would only flash, but not stay lit)– Replaced the little lighted ring around the cigar lighter/12v socket – it works now!– Replaced a burned out brake lamp– Replaced a burned out license plate lamp and cleaned the fixtures out– Finished re-attaching the battery strap so it holds the battery to the body now– Finished epoxying in rivnuts and screwing the battery door back to the body– Pulled off the driver’s side rear panel to replace the speaker. Discovered the speaker is already a replacement and is actually working fine, it appears the issue there is in the tape deck itself. Put the new speaker in since I was back there anyway. Did not replace the passenger’s side speaker, as it would require way too much cutting.Colleen and I then went for a nice long drive around town in it. It’s a pleasure to drive (although one jackass getting too close on my ass at a stoplight on a hill caused a bit of a panic) and runs like a top. I believe it might need new brakes and an alignment, so i’ll add that to the list…As always, pictures are in the gallery" }, { "title": "Restoration, Log 4", "url": "/2011/03/restoration-log-4/", "categories": "General Thoughts, Legacy Restoration Log", "tags": "restoration, repair, events", "date": "2011-03-30 12:53:00 -0700", "snippet": "I’m heading to meet another DeLorean owner in the area at 6 tonight. It will be fun to get a perspective on mine based on what he’s done and seen already. It’s not like dealing with a Mustang or a common classic where everyone knows what it should “be” like – there are a pretty small group of people who have any idea.In preparation, I replaced the muffler heat shield with the brand new one I bought. the old one was a burned up sheet of raw asbestos. The new one is a fancy heat-absorbing weave bonded to a sheet of solid stainless. It looks better and should work better too.Pics, as always, are in the repair log." }, { "title": "Restoration, Log 3", "url": "/2011/03/restoration-log-3/", "categories": "General Thoughts, Legacy Restoration Log", "tags": "restoration, repair", "date": "2011-03-27 11:22:00 -0700", "snippet": "Today’s progress:– Repaired the glove box latch mechanism– Replaced the glove box light assembly– Replaced the secondary pressure switch on the driver’s side door that operates the key/door buzzer (still doesn’t work though – more to come)– Replaced the passenger side door strut (2nd time, first strut I got was defective)– Replaced the passenger side lower door sill sealPhotos as always are in the repair log." }, { "title": "Restoration, Log 2", "url": "/2011/03/restoration-log-2/", "categories": "General Thoughts, Legacy Restoration Log", "tags": "restoration, repair", "date": "2011-03-18 16:37:00 -0700", "snippet": "Another day of DeLorean repair. Today’s work involved re-threading the battery strap and rebuilding the driver’s side inner rear CV joint.Mike came over and helped with the joint. We just took out the rear left half-shaft, cleaned and rebuilt the joint, and reinstalled the shaft. It’s raining out and also quite dark by now, so I haven’t done a road test – but it looks better than new.The battery strap is a huge pain in my ass. I’m not quite sure what I’m going to do with it, as only one half of the strap is adjustable, and it’s cut to length specifically for the original battery, which is no longer available, and of course is no longer in the car. I’ll figure something out, i guess…Anyway, that’s all for now. No pictures of the CV joint work as it was just too frigging messy to deal with a camera.II also discovered a torn air intake hose while under the car, so that’s another new job. No big deal and should be pretty easy to replace.Now if you’ll excuse me, i’m off to degrease all my tools." }, { "title": "Restoration, Log 1", "url": "/2011/03/restoration-log-1/", "categories": "General Thoughts, Legacy Restoration Log", "tags": "restoration, repair", "date": "2011-03-12 07:46:00 -0800", "snippet": "Just got myself cleaned up after about 6 hours of working on the D.

If you know me at all, you know that I’ve spent my entire life (literally since i knew how to want something) lusting after a DeLorean. I never actually thought in a million years that i’d get one, but this was a big month for me.Just two days ago, on Wednesday the 9th, i picked up a 1981 DeLorean, VIN #2100. She’s a beautiful, all-original example that runs and drives great. Of course, it’s not without a few issues – none of them ever were or ever will be. Fortunately, I love a challenge, I love to work with my hands, and I can’t wait to get started. Pictures of the car are here, and will include photos of various stages of work I do on it.I’ve decided i’m going to try and keep a log of the progress I make on the car here on the site. We’ll see if I actually remember to do it, but I’ll try.To start, here’s my laundry list after a thorough going-over and a hundred or so miles behind the wheel.Major:– replace oil light sending unit plug– remove code alarm and restore factory wiring– re-attach driver’s side inner cv boot– a/c leak test and charge– replace exhaust heat shieldMinor:– rebuild locking gas cap– washer squirter not squirting– replace side marker gaskets– reattach/replace weather stripping around boot area– replace drivers side door gasket– troubleshoot drivers side door running lights– troubleshoot power mirrors– replace door struts– replace headliners– troubleshoot central locking (pass side)– troubleshoot lock tumbler (pass side)– re-attach or replace loose trim panel pass side door– reattach steering column leather cowl– glove box latch not latching– glove box light out– replace shift boot– reattach battery door– chip on blackened area above windshield– slight corrosion in door channel on pass side– rear louver clip – realign– u-bolt for engine cover release– engine bay light out– taillight bulb outUpgrades:– wheels (refinish/repair/replace)– stereo upgrade– replace door lights with led bulbsStay tuned…." } ]
