This is a super fun event that the university puts on every year, giving the students, faculty, staff, and local community a chance to come together and have some really great times. It’s one of the highlights of the year in Davis, and a really fun tradition. Sadly, it was cancelled in both 2020 and 2021 because of the pandemic.

I did the springs and steering a while ago, as the steering shaft had basically seized solid (and this had in turn caused the pinion gear in the rack to be worn smooth) and someone had tried to lower the car years ago by blowtorching the springs. They were all twist... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Getting caught up</title><link href="https://www.8bitdmc.com/2017/06/getting-caught-up/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Getting caught up" /><published>2017-06-19T19:33:20-07:00</published> <updated>2022-04-26T09:56:32-07:00</updated> <id>https://www.8bitdmc.com/2017/06/getting-caught-up/</id> <content src="https://www.8bitdmc.com/2017/06/getting-caught-up/" /> <author> <name>admin</name> </author> <category term="General Thoughts" /> <summary> Wow, has it really been almost three years since my last post? I didn’t realize how much time had gone by. Between work and all the other stuff going on, I just haven’t thought to keep this site up to date with everything I’ve done. Yesterday was a huge event for 8BIT, so before I launch into that more detailed post I thought I would just document the last couple of years worth of work in one ... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Time for an alignment</title><link href="https://www.8bitdmc.com/2015/01/time-for-an-alignment/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Time for an alignment" /><published>2015-01-22T17:14:33-08:00</published> <updated>2022-04-26T09:56:32-07:00</updated> <id>https://www.8bitdmc.com/2015/01/time-for-an-alignment/</id> <content src="https://www.8bitdmc.com/2015/01/time-for-an-alignment/" /> <author> <name>admin</name> </author> <category term="General Thoughts" /> <summary> Long ago, nearly two years before I started this blog, #2100 got a new steering rack. This was due to the incredible steering difficulty that came from a completely seized intermediate shaft as well as the fact that it wasn’t tracking straight. No big deal, it was a relatively simple job for an afternoon. But since then, it hasn’t had the wheels aligned. We did the best we could with tape meas... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Another new water pump</title><link href="https://www.8bitdmc.com/2015/01/another-new-water-pump/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Another new water pump" /><published>2015-01-11T10:44:08-08:00</published> <updated>2022-04-26T09:56:32-07:00</updated> <id>https://www.8bitdmc.com/2015/01/another-new-water-pump/</id> <content src="https://www.8bitdmc.com/2015/01/another-new-water-pump/" /> <author> <name>admin</name> </author> <category term="General Thoughts" /> <summary> So this was a surprise but not entirely unexpected job. Last weekend, after coming home from our holiday trip I noticed a small drip of coolant under the car. This isn’t at all unusual when it starts to get cold outside – there are dozens of hose to pipe connections under the car, and they will develop small drips from time to time with drastic temperature changes. So I pulled out my pressure t... </summary> </entry> </feed>
