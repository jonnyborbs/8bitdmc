Making some progress today. Still donâ€™t have my clutch parts yet so my weekend schedule is coming into question, but I was able to start getting the rear quarter panel reinstalled.

First job was scraping the old weatherstripping off the T and quarter panels.

Got the new plastic infill panel drilled and glued in place, and once the glue cures (tomorrow) I can drop the stainless back in place.
