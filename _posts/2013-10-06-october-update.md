We’ve been so busy this last few weeks that it’s been a pretty slow DeLorean season.

I did get the new door struts installed, which is a great feeling. The doors finally lift themselves all the way up and stay there again. They lost that ability so gradually that I didn’t notice until they were whacking me in the head.

A couple weekends ago I tackled a leaky RH valve cover gasket, we just hadn’t used enough sealant on it and it was weeping around the lower edge. Got that sealed up nice and tight, though I worry about what kind of a mess I might be in for the next time I have to change that gasket. I also think that the rear main seal may still (!) be leaking a tiny bit. That freaking thing…what a pain.

I also discovered that my two year old water pump may be starting to leak. I’m not 100% sure if it is or how bad it is yet, but it’s undeniable that there is a glob of coolant baked onto the timing cover where the water pump meets the block. I pressure tested the system and it held 16PSI for an hour and everything is staying cool, so I am going to monitor this and see. I really don’t want to do another water pump.

On Thursday 8bit hit a milestone, clocking 56,000 miles on the odometer. Still just a baby if you ask me, and we’ve got many many more miles to go!

And yesterday we took a nice long drive out to Napa to enjoy the perfect weather and pick up some wine. These pictures don’t do the day justice, but they sure help give an idea…

That’s all for now! Next weekend I’m going to work on David’s A/C with Clint, and the weekend after that is the Sacramento Korean festival – they’ve invited us to show the cars in exchange for free food. How can I say no to that?
