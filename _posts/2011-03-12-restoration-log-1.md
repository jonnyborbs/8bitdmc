Just got myself cleaned up after about 6 hours of working on the D. Today’s tasks included replacing the gas struts on the doors, hood, and louvers, as well as fully removing the alarm and restoring the factory wiring harness. I also replaced the foam side marker gaskets with new rubber ones and rebuilt the locking gas cap so it actually works now.

All the tasks were a complete success, with the added bonus that removing the alarm bullshit restored the taillights and driver’s side door electrical system to working order.

Pictures from today’s work are [here](https://www.orangeoblivion.com/gallery/index.php?/category/repair-log-details-of-repairs-made), as will all future pictures be!
