Another huge victory today. I finally got the rest of my electrical system parts in and spent the last two days completely removing the breakers, relays and fuse block from the electrical compartment. I had to pull each pair out of the block, label it and then record the colors, orientation and block # in a spreadsheet. Then, I cut off all the barrel terminals, re-crimped new ones and re-labeled the pairs. Then, soldered all of the terminal joints to the wires and re-labeled the pairs a third time. Once all the soldering was done, I reinstalled the pairs into the fuse block, replaced the remaining breakers and re-installed all the relays.

The net result of what added up to about 16 hours of hunching over the tiny and barely accessible electrical bay breathing solder fumes is a gorgeous new electrical bay with a fresh new fuse block in which nothing is melted or overrated. Everything is clean and neat and modernized, and should last another 30 years with no problem.

Basically, I turned [this](https://www.orangeoblivion.com/gallery/picture.php?/8901/category/repair-log-details-of-repairs-made) into [this](https://www.orangeoblivion.com/gallery/picture.php?/8945/category/repair-log-details-of-repairs-made). A huge improvement if you ask meâ€¦

Now that the electrical system is modern and reliable, itâ€™s time to focus on the A/C â€“ before the summer heat hits us! So, I ordered all new hoses, a new compressor, a new accumulator and pressure switches, refrigerant, oils, sealsâ€¦ the whole deal. Clint and I will tear the old stuff out and replace it with a brand new R134a system next week sometime. It will be great to have working A/C again ðŸ™‚

As always, pictures are in the [repair log ](https://www.orangeoblivion.com/gallery/index.php?/category/repair-log-details-of-repairs-made)â€“ itâ€™s getting to be pretty extensive.
