There just hasn’t been anything much to write about! The car has been running and working perfectly – better than new. Other than needing to do a new outer door seal on the passenger side (kind of a nightmare, actually) there’s no work actively on my to-do list. The oil leaks are completely gone, the new radiator is tight and leak-free, the A/C is nice and cold and everything is ducky, for once.

That doesn’t excuse me for not having some fun travel pictures or other adventures to share, but the weather has been so hot the last few weeks I barely even want to leave the house.

Stay tuned…
