Today’s progress:

– Repaired the glove box latch mechanism  
– Replaced the glove box light assembly  
– Replaced the secondary pressure switch on the driver’s side door that operates the key/door buzzer (still doesn’t work though – more to come)  
– Replaced the passenger side door strut (2nd time, first strut I got was defective)  
– Replaced the passenger side lower door sill seal
