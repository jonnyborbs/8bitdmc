Some good news. I finally have a clutch coming – for real this time. It will be here Tuesday, and we should have it installed Saturday!

In anticipation, I decided to suck it up and rebuild my CV joints. It isn’t a hard job at all, but it’s up there with the nastiest, most disgusting undertakings on the car. But I had a half day at work and was feeling froggy. Got all 3 done (I did one that had a torn boot as soon as I got the car)

Here’s one of the joints, after disassembly, cleaning and reassembly but before re-packing and booting

And here’s both drive shafts, all cleaned up and ready for another 30 years!

And just for the hell of it, here’s a glamour shot. The doors are going to be nice and straight when all is said and done!
