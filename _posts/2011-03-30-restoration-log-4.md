I’m heading to meet another DeLorean owner in the area at 6 tonight. It will be fun to get a perspective on mine based on what he’s done and seen already. It’s not like dealing with a Mustang or a common classic where everyone knows what it should “be” like – there are a pretty small group of people who have any idea.

In preparation, I replaced the muffler heat shield with the brand new one I bought. the old one was a burned up sheet of raw asbestos. The new one is a fancy heat-absorbing weave bonded to a sheet of solid stainless. It looks better and should work better too.

Pics, as always, are in the [repair log](https://www.orangeoblivion.com/gallery/index.php?/category/repair-log-details-of-repairs-made).
