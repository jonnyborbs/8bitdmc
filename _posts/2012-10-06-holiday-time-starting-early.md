Today I did something Iâ€™ve never done before, and I have to say I never thought I would. I got up early to be at the Hallmark store when it opened to get Christmas tree ornaments.

Stick with me here. This year they released a Back To The Future time machine.

Anyway, counting the one a friend got me at another store I ended up with 4 of these. One for me, one each for Clint and David and one for an unnamed party who may receive it as a surprise.

Cool stuff!
