Been working on a major engine and transmission overhaul for the past few weekends. It was only supposed to take one, but a defective clutch disk has drawn it out over quite a bit longer. Since the car was out of commission while I wait for new parts anyway, we decided to tackle the door strut mounting studs. This required the removal of the rear quarter panels, which leaves the car looking sort of sad. This weekend is probably an “off” weekend since Clint has other things to do (how dare he!) but hopefully all the right parts should be here by the 7th and we can get everything put back together and running. I can’t wait to drive it again.
