Just a quick update. Still no clutch parts when I got home from work today, so I started putting the body back together. Got the quarter panel, T panel and rear fascia reinstalled. Panel alignment is better than before due to the roof box being bolted back down. The motor is still supported by the jack since there’s no transmission installed yet. Soon…
