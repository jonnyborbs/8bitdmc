Tonight was another Davis cruise-in. I haven’t been to one since last year but should really go more often – they are free, and very laid back. Not too huge a spectator crowd tonight, but a decent car turnout. A few dumb questions, a few cute kids, a couple good looking girls (college town, after all… Oh, and Colleen too) and the usual owner crowd.

And as a bonus, I wasn’t the only D there! I can always count on Clint to show up to things like that.

The night ended with some guy offering to buy both our cars as we were getting ready to leave. Was pretty weird and I threw out a crazy number and drove off. Clint was still talking to him as I left…

Now, on to the pictures!
