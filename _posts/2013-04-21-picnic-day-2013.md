Time again for what’s becoming an NCDMC tradition! The annual Picnic Day parade at UC Davis. It was a blast as always, with plenty of people to amuse and impress. I had hoped to have 10 cars but schedule conflicts kept us down to 5 this year. Next year is the 100th anniversary of the event, so I hope we can really have an amazing owner turnout!

Here are some photos from the day:

Ryan, looking snazzy in his new car and Tyvek suit. We’re hoping next year he puts a trefoil on the back.
