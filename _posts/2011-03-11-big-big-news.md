OK, so, huge news. If you know me at all, you know that I’ve spent my entire life (literally since i knew how to want something) lusting after a DeLorean. I never actually thought in a million years that i’d get one, but this was a big month for me.

Just two days ago, on Wednesday the 9th, i picked up a 1981 DeLorean, VIN #2100. She’s a beautiful, all-original example that runs and drives great. Of course, it’s not without a few issues – none of them ever were or ever will be. Fortunately, I love a challenge, I love to work with my hands, and I can’t wait to get started. Pictures of the car are [here](https://www.orangeoblivion.com/gallery/v/vehicles/81dmc2100/), and will include photos of various stages of work I do on it.

I’ve decided i’m going to try and keep a log of the progress I make on the car here on the site. We’ll see if I actually remember to do it, but I’ll try.

To start, here’s my laundry list after a thorough going-over and a hundred or so miles behind the wheel.

Major:  
– replace oil light sending unit plug  
– remove code alarm and restore factory wiring  
– re-attach driver’s side inner cv boot

– replace shift boot  
– reattach battery door

– slight corrosion in door channel on pass side  
– rear louver clip – realign
